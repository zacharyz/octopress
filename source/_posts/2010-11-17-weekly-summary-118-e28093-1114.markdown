## Summary

**389 calories** over budget for the week. Lost **0 pounds** this week.  
Injured and sick while on a company trip where they were paying for all the
food and drinks I could handle. How do you think things went? Despite several
days where I was over budget I was able to remarkable maintain my current
weight of 170.6.

I didn't want _not_ enjoy myself so I picked and chose what calories I did
enjoy. White Mocha at Starbucks? Pass. Ginger Ale? Pass. Instead I saved
myself for delicious steaks and ramen and cut the easy snacks the rest of the
time.

So while I did enjoy myself I did try to stick to my calorie budget and the
results were that I was able to maintain my current weight. This makes me
happy but at the time it freaks me out because if it was that hard to simply
maintain my current weight then what is going to happen when I didn't have a
budget?

Not everyone can watch their diet, exercise or expect to be healthy every day.
If I wasn't actively tracking my calories I would have been clueless as to how
much I was actually eating and honestly it never felt like I was eating very
much.

The rest of this week I plan to be recovering from the cold I got last week
and resting my ankle. Hopefully next week I will be healthy enough to start
exercising again otherwise this week is going to be another week of
maintenance.
