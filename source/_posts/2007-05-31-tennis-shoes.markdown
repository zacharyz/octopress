It has been a while since I got a new pair of tennis shoes. I have wide feet
and have been a big fan of the nike air resolve line of shoes. They are a few
seasons old so you can find them for cheap. The main thing that drew me to
them is that they are built like tanks.

It is hard to tell from those images but the toe area is surrounded by some
fairly durable plastic. Still, after about 9 months of play I managed to grind
that plastic away. My main issue with those shoes is that the durability came
at the cost of weight. They come in at around 16.9 ounces. Opponents consider
me pretty speedy around the court but I always felt like I was weighed down by
those shoes.

While returning a demo racquet at the local tennis shop today I ended up
getting a pair of Nike Max Breathe Free IIs.

They came pretty highly recommended on the tennis-warehouse forums, and were
the best fitting shoes out of the bunch that I tried. They come in at about
15.5 ounces which on paper doesn't seem all that much lighter. But on court
today turned out to be a drastic difference. My hitting partner remarked on
several occasions that I was able to track down shots he thought were
impossible to retrieve. They definitely felt a lot lighter and more
maneuverable than any tennis shoe that I have used before.

They may not appear to be as durable as the air resolves but they still come
with a 6 month warranty. So if I play like I have been playing I will most
likely get a second pair for free.

On another note just before winning my 4th straight game of 21 I managed to
roll my ankle. Thankfully it doesn't appear to be as bad as previous rolls :/.
