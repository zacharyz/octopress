Brussels was actually the last stop on our trip. We managed to find some
relatively cheap tickets out of Brussels back to Portland so decided to spend
a day here. By the time we got to Brussels though we were exhausted and ended
up sleeping all day in our hostel so we didn't get to explore much. We were
fortunate enough though to be about a block away from one of the city's main
attractions - [The Grand Place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Place).

The Grand Place - or Grote Markt is a square in the middle of the city. The
main attractions are the Town Hall and The Maison du Roi (King's House). These
buildings are considered to be some of the most beautiful in Europe.

Towards the middle of the above picture are a group of Americans embarrassing
themselves after one of them drank way more than she could handle. Shortly
after this was taken she sprung up, sprinted across the square, then tripped
and fell on her face. Police eventually looked in on them and advised that she
get up because the bricks get cold at night.

At night the city puts on a little show at the Town Hall with lights and
music. The sound of this event was enough to drag me out of bed and encourage
me to take some pictures.

actually some where on this street. It didn't even have a sign. One of the
things I am going to miss about Belgium in particular was enjoying a [trappist
beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer). For about one euro you can
get a [11.3% ABV Rochefort
10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochefort_Brewery). There was just something
about drinking a beer that had first been brewed over 400 years ago.

Thanks for looking. A collection of (most) of the pictures I took on my trip
can be found on my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/collections/
