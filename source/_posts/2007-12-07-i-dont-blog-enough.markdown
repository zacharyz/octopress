Since my last post a whole lot has happened and I haven't talked about any of
it. Every topic deserves its own post but now you get a summary. What has
happened since my last post:

  * My girlfriend of over a year moved in with me.
  * I have played a whole lot of tennis, but not nearly as much as I want to. I burned through those tennis shoes that I got just in time for the 6 month durability warranty and I still haven't bought new racquets.
  * I have been playing a shit ton of video games and consider this to be the best year for gaming since 1998.
  * I have been building up my home theater which includes the HDTV I have mentioned before in addition to an Onkyo ht-sr800 htib, playstation 3, and an xbox 360.
  * I have enjoyed having the freedom of having a car and so far have found little to no faults in buying a used car.
  * I have been enjoying the new season of television which is about to end thanks to the writer's strike. My favorite show has been Dexter.
  * I haven't taken nearly as many photos as I would like but have been studying photography a bit. I got a teleconverter lens and plan to get a macro lens soon.
Work has been crazy lately and exciting at the same time. I don't see this
site ever being a place for me to talk about work because I believe in a
strict separation of my work and personal life, but since it takes up so much
of my mind I think it deserves some mention. It has been amazing to see a
place I have been at for ~3 years suddenly become a real startup and finally
begin to live up to the potential I saw in it coming out of college. This next
year is going to be very telling. I have had moments this year where I wasn't
sure if I wanted to continue with my current job and Eugene to loving both
profusely. My company is in a position to become a globally recognized power
house and I am in a position where I can help to control its focus and
direction and hopefully reap from its success.

Next week I leave on my first real vacation since moving here. I get to go
back to Hawaii where hopefully I can take a break from working and enjoy sand,
swimming, surfing, tennis, amazing food, sun, scuba diving, family and
hopefully a whole lot more.
