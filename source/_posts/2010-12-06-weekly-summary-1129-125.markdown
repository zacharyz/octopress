## Summary

**3,175 calories** under budget for the week. Lost **1.8 pounds** this week.  
Still making progress - if not much. I feel like I am about 2 weeks tops from
reaching my goal for the year. I got as low as 162.3 this week, but for the
most part stayed around 163 throughout the week. With the end in sight I am
definitely appreciating just how much my body has changed in only ~27 pounds.
Even though I wasn't thrilled with how I looked at 190 I still felt that I was
better off than the majority of the population. People are really starting to
take notice though which feels awesome.

I am at the point where I can't imagine not using loseit to track my diet. I
don't want to go back to just eating whatever is put in front of me without
thinking about the consequences. That is what got me 30 pounds heavier in the
first place. I feel that with my current diet I am not getting enough food,
but because I am sidelined and not doing anything that requires mobility I
haven't needed to eat more than I am.

My ankle _still_ feels jacked. I tried running on it earlier in the week and
didn't get more than a few blocks before I was back to hobbling. It is really
frustrating to get so into running only to be sidelined like this for as long
as I have been. Thankfully I am no longer suffering from that cold that I
suffered through for the past couple of weeks.
