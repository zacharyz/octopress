For the past year and a half a buddy of mine has loaned me some space to host
this blog. While this was a good starting point it did have a lot of
limitations. So I finally caved and found a host that offered a good balance
between space, bandwidth, privileges and cost.

I get unlimited domains, databases, email accounts etc. The only limitation is
space and bandwidth. All for about $30 a _year_.

I also took the opportunity to transfer my blog's database and update to the
latest version of wordpress. I am not entirely happy with this theme but it is
good enough for now.

Hopefully I will be able to use this new host to experiment with some projects
in the future.
