I spend every day at work making web apps so when it came down to making
a site for my upcoming wedding I wanted something simple. I decided to forego using any frameworks
or even using a database and instead make a single page - static site. Check it
out at <a href="http://zacharyandseyoung.com">zacharyandseyoung.com</a>.

The goal of the design was convey all the information that our guests
would need - date, place, directions etc. Additionally though I wanted to make 
sure that once guests traveled here they would have a great list of
things to do that didn't involve the wedding and which would hopefully
give them an appreciation for the city that we love and call home.

I also wanted something that would look good on either a PC, tablet or
phone.

Some highlights:

- The site itself is just html/css/js using bootstrap for its basic grid system
and mobile friendly responsiveness with some custom styling.

- It uses some additional js that wasn't included in stock bootstrap like fitvid.js for video 
resizing and sticky.js for the navigation but over all I was able to accomplish what I wanted 
much faster than without it. 

- The RSVP form is just a simple wufoo form that emails us when someone
registers.
