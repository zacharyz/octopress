I recently upgraded my flickr to a pro account which has inspired me to backup
all the old photos I took with my Canon S3IS. While doing so I stumbled across
some panoramas I took during my vacation last year but never stitched together
so I decided to try and find a way to develop them.

When I first saw them I had forgotten that they were part of a panorama,
because by themselves the shots weren't very remarkable. When I tried to
manually stitch them together in photoshop I found them to be misaligned.
Thankfully CS3 has a feature that automates the merging of pictures. You
basically give it a list of photos and it will try to create a panorama out of
them.

Here are results:
