The glory of these falls is definitely the journey. 

They are found in the Columbia River Gorge but there is no clear
path to it. You have to trek down a game path - through mud and ferns
and over logs before making your way down a cliff to get here.

Once you get there it feels like you have your own private water fall
because you know no one is going to randomly stumble upon it without
working for it.
