## Summary

**2743** calories under budget for the week. Lost **2.8 pounds** this week.  
What is this? An actual good week for weight loss? It feels like I was stuck
in the low 170s for a while and then this week I lost nearly 4 pounds (I
weighed in this morning at 166.8). All this despite not being able to run and
having a cold. It would be easy to point towards my cold as the source of my
weight loss, and that may turn out to be the case later, but it hasn't been
the sort of cold that has resulted in me puking a lot, so I don't think that
will be the case. Instead I look towards the strong calorie restriction that I
have been doing. Because I haven't been exercising I haven't needed to eat as
much I usually do, which means I have been consuming far less calories then
previously.

I also believe that I gave my body some time to recover from my trip, so once
it fully digested everything the weight started to fall off. I didn't even get
to see 169, as I went straight to 168.8 from the 170s, as I mentioned in an
earlier post.

If I can continue with this weight loss I am on schedule to complete my goal
mid-December. This doesn't factor in Thanksgiving of course. Still this means
it may actually be possible to make my goal before the New Year.
