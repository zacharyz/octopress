Yesterday as I was returning home from work I saw a familiar face locking up a
bike outside my apartment. It turned out to be a friend of Seyoung's who lives
here in Copenhagen - [Chyi Chyi](http://chyix2.blogspot.com/)!.

After meeting with Seyoung for the first time in person, Chyi then proceeded
to treat us both to dinner and a long tour of East Copenhagen otherwise known
as [Frederiksstaden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederiksstaden).

The tour began with a walk through some yellow housing known as [Nyboder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyboder).

My first view of the [Marble Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik's_Church):

For dinner we were treated to traditional Danish food at Restaurant Vita which
was in a building over 300 years old. I had the fried pork with parsley sauce.

After dinner Chyi took us through downtown to the opera house:

We then walked past a canal where tons of people were enjoying a Jazz
festival.

As the sun began to set we approached the Royal Danish PlayHouse:

The tour then headed towards the [AmalienborgPalace"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalienborg_Palace) where the Danish
royal family lives. Before that we past by some gardens and a fountain.

After the fountain we got our first glimpse of the palace square:

After the palace we made our way to [St Alban's Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Alban's_Church,_Copenhagen)

Next to it was the [Gefion Fountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefion_Fountain)

Eventually we got to the spotwhere there is usually a [statue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(statue) of the
Little Mermaid that was made famous by [Hans Christian Andersen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen). 
The statue is currently on display in China, so instead we were _treated_ to a big screen in the water.

The tour ended with a walk through the The Genetically Modified Paradise which included variations of the little mermaid statue.

Copenhagen is a compact and beautiful city and it was a pleasure to have such
a fantastic tour of this part of it. Thanks again Chyi! For more of the
pictures I have taken during my stay in Copenhagen - feel free to visit my
