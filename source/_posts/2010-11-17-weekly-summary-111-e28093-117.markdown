## Summary

**3800** calories under budget for the week. Lost **1.4 pounds** this week.  
This week I continued where I left off and started upping my running distance
to 10ks. To mix it up some I tried to see how fast I could run a 5k.
Previously my fastest time was 29:06, I was able to destroy it with a time of
26:07. I decided to follow up this run with another 10k run on Friday that
didn't end so well. With about 2 miles left I felt my left ankle cramp some -
being a complete moron I decided to run through it for the rest of the run. I
can't stress just how bad an idea this was. If your body hurts - listen to it.
It turns out that it wasn't a cramp but a strain, and by running on it longer
for the next two miles I was just making it worse. For the rest of the week I
was unable to run - or even walk for that matter.

I also decided that I was going to quit my martial arts class. Studying jiu
jitsu and muay thai is actually something that I enjoyed quite a bit - but the
school itself not so much. At some point I got turned off because I kept being
grouped up with people who had even less experience than I had and by the
feeling that the people who were running the school were more interested in
getting me to test for belts rather than improving. This is unfortunate
because I was planning on relying on having the gym available to work out when
it gets too cold to run.

My main goal for this week was to get below 170 before a business trip in the
next week. My injury unfortunately got in the way of my progress and instead I
had to rely on strictly dieting - but I was able to get down to 170.6.
