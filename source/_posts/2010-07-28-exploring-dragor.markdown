not get to explore much of Denmark outside of Copenhagen. I was able to visit
a small harbor town located 12 km outside of Copenhagen named
[Dragor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag%C3%B8r), which despite its simple
spelling - is quite hard to pronounce. The most remarkable thing about this
town was its many well perserved picturesque historical buildings.

itself, other than it is small and very cute. The buildings are all very
historic Danish with yellow paint, cobblestone streets and the occasional
thatched roof.

The town was quite touristy and had two bars near the harbor which each
exclusively served one of the two main competing beers in Copenhagen. We dined
at the one that served Carlsberg.

Still the town clearly had a lively amount of fisherman, which thanks to their
tans, were easily to tell apart from the tourists.
