This is a panorama made up of about 11 overlapping shots. I took it as I was making my
way down from the summit. It wasn't until I was making the journey down that I
really had an appreciation for just how beastly a journey it had been (8 hours
to the top for me).

One of the things I like about this shot is that you can see tiny specs that
are other hikers making the same journey that I had made.
