I visited Palgongsan while visiting family in Daegu South Korea in March during my 3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.

This was yet another example of a landscape dominated by the haze from
pollution from China. To get here you take a beautiful ride up in a
cable car that seems designed to appeal to young lovers.
