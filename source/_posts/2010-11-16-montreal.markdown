I was in Montreal for the past week to attend [Unite 2010](http://unity3d.com/unite/).

This is the first time that I have traveled to Canada, so add one more country
to the _list_ of new countries I have visited this year.

Montreal felt very European to me with its architecture and cobble stone
streets. This contrasted greatly with the people who lived there. At one
moment I could be sitting next to a group of people speaking perfect English
as they discussed video games, then in the next I would be surrounded by
people who only spoke French.

I am not used to being so well treated on a company trip. I am used to sharing
cheap motels with co-workers as we tested how many we can pile in a single
room. For this trip each of us were setup in 4 star hotels in the middle of
Old Town Montreal, just a block away from the [Notre-Dame Basilica of

Overall Montreal was a beautiful city with nice people and great food I just
wish I didn't get sick mid-trip and was able to appreciate it more.
