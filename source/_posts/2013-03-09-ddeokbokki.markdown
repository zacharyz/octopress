Ddeokbokki is one of the first Korean dishes that Seyoung taught me.
Whenever she is sick and needs something spicy and comforting I make it
for her. It is simply made up of rice cakes, fish cakes, vegetables and
a chilli paste based sauce.

Before coming to Korea I had no idea just how common a dish it
is. Just about everywhere we went it could be found on street corners
sold by vendors. It is also pretty cheap - a typical meal costs about
$3 and was enough to feed two. At the end of a busy day of sight seeing we would find a random street vendor who would serve it with a warm cup of broth and eat it with tooth picks.
