## Summary

**630 calories** under budget for the week. Lost **0.2 pounds** this week.  
Talk about a week of ups and downs.

This is without a doubt my _worst_ week of dieting since I began this
challenge. I flew down to San Francisco for a company meeting and dinner which
resulted in a huge spike in my weight. It was the combination of lots of good
beer, mediocre food and no exercise (beyond walking to the office). When I got
back I saw that I had gained about 2 pounds. So instead of getting down to
170, I found myself back up to 175.

How did I respond to this? By going on [my longest run ever](http://nikerunnin
g.nike.com/nikeos/p/nikeplus/en_US/plus/?sitesrc=twit_ab_plus#//runs/detail/12
16555972/1370811448/all/allRuns/) - 10k or 6.2 miles. Not even in high-school
did I run that far without stopping, this time I did it easily. At the
beginning of this challenge I was barely running 5k, and this week I was able
to double that and do it at a good pace as well.

The progress didn't last long though as I soon had to go to a buffet with my
girlfriend's family. It was the last night of the season that they would be
serving lobster, so we just had to attend. Of course I was way over budget. To
respond to this though everyone went on a 2.5 hour hike. This is the first
time that I have hiked in my VFF trek shoes and they were perfect for the
task.

At the end of the week I was _barely_ under budget. In the morning though I
found myself at 172 so I _did_ make some progress. It is only going to get
harder though as the weather gets wetter and with an upcoming (week long) trip
to Montreal coming up but I am still committed to getting this weight off.

I have it easy being able to eat most of my meals at home. I didn't go out of
my way to indulge this week, it was only a result of socializing with
coworkers and family - the sort of things that everybody goes through on a
daily basis and yet it was enough to have a negative impact on my diet. Some
times dieting is so easy - keep your calories below your budget and exercise -
and yet in reality it can be a huge challenge with how plentiful unhealthy
food is in our society.
