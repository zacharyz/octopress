Getting hit with a big fat sound violation on a Saturday afternoon didn't sit
very well with Chris. A few days later we had talk. We had talked a couple
times before about the sound issues and each time Oliver managed to avoid it
and each time nothing good had come of it. The guy manages to disappear and
leave only Chris to deal with me and everyone else. I don't honestly know if I
would have _not _called the cops if I had known it was Chris who was making
all the noise because he is a good and reasonable guy in general. Up until
this point Oliver was the main source of annoyance and now he had pissed off
me and Chris - who was now faced with having to pay a fine he couldn't afford
and possible eviction if anything more happened in the future.

The gist of the conversation is that slow talking Chris expressed his anger at
the situation, I expressed my even greater anger, and Oliver tried to once
again avoid confrontation and leave everything on Chris. Everything about
Oliver rubs me the wrong way, from the way he dresses to the way he talks to
the kind of music he likes. It doesn't help that I have heard from his own
mouth what a horrible person he is so seeing him avoid a situation that he
created caused me to really lose my cool in a manner that I am not proud of. I
didn't hit him, but I was certainly on verge of doing it if he provoked me any
further.

He called me a "square" and flicked his cigarette at my feet.

I called him a "child" and a "clown."

Chris managed to raise his voice and show anger at Oliver for the first time.

The end result is that Chris agreed that Oliver was a problem and that he
would do his best to keep the noise levels down and avoid talking outside my
window as long as I agreed not to call the cops in the future.

If only that was the end.
