Today marks one week on the island and on vacation.

I had wanted to get out every night to grab a sunset while here but
family obligations began to take its tole on me and required that I take
some evenings off to get some rest. 

Today we rented a car and decided to tour the island. We began with a
trip across the island to Lanakai Beach - which many consider one of the
best beaches in the world. I was able to swim to one of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7007734326">Mokulua Islands</a> and
enjoy the bird sanctuary there before swimming back.

Despite being here for a week I had yet to have some Ramen. Thankfully we stumbled upon <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7154502656">Rai Rai Ramen</a> in Kailua which was superb. Then we made our way to the Valley of the Temples to visit the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7156944902">Byodo-In Temple</a>.

We continued north to grab a quick shave ice from Aoki's in Haleiwa then
finally made our way to Kaena Point on the west side of the island to
grab this sunset.
