PdaNet is a program that works on windows mobile based phones that allows you
to use the data connection in conjunction with a computer. Since I have
unlimited data on my phone, it basically means I can have a net connection
wherever I get reception. Being away at [Gamefest](http://www.xnagamefest.com)
in Seattle the past few days, I have had a lot of opportunities to take
advantage of this.

The free wifi at the convention center was horrible. Despite being a solid
connection it was so bogged down from all the other attendees that it was
unusable. In the hotel I was staying in they actually charge for a network
connection.

Pdanet to the rescue!

The connection itself is around 2Mb/s, which is more than adequate. I
certainly don't plan on downloading huge files with it, but for checking my
email, browsing the web and watching youtube videos it kicks ass.
