## Summary

**3,488 calories under budget for the week.**

**Lost 1 pound this week.**

  
Compared to the first three weeks this week has been relatively conservative
in terms of weight loss despite plenty of exercise and reasonable calorie
deficits. This week I decided to listen to my body and turn down the
intensity. One of my ankles were cranked in a submission during jiu jitsu
practice and my calves were feeling tight because of all the running I have
been doing in Vibram Five Fingers. So this weekend I actually didn't do
anything that resembled exercise. I also was worried that I was becoming
dehydrated. I got as low as 176 after some of my workouts then rehydrated back
up to 179/180.

One side effect of my weight loss is that I have to run further to get the
same calorie burn on my runs. So I am going to slowly move towards running 4+
miles each run vs my usual 5k/3.11 miles. I also want to experiment with
running some HIITs, which are basically intervals of high and low intensity
during my runs vs a consistent pace throughout. My slow and steady running
style is enabling me to run further but I feel like my body is simply adapting
to the pace without getting faster.
