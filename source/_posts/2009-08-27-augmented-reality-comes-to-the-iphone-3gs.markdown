![](/images/IMG_0122.PNG) One of my favorite books ever is Snow Crash by Neal
Stephenson. It is a sci-fi novel centered around a sword wielding computer
hacker that has been extremely influential to many people working with
computers today. The word "avatar" in reference to a computer representation
of a person was first coined in this book - so just about every major MMO or
Virtual Reality system that has come out has been influenced by this book.

Another cool idea from Snow Crash was that of a "gargoyle," which is basically
an individual who is perpetually connected to the net - complete with an eye
piece display that enables them pull up information about their surroundings
at all time. This is slowly becoming a reality and Yelp is doing their part by
bringing the first Augmented Reality app to the iPhone 3GS.

Yelp quietly snuck the feature into their latest update - revealed by shaking
your phone 3 times. After that a dialog pops up stating how Yelp thought
reality was boring - so they augmented it. From that point on the yelp app
displays a monocle option that allows you to use the 3GS's camera to look
around and display yelp information.

Yelp isn't the first AR app, but they are the first on the iphone. On android
based phones - like the G1, there have been other AR apps - in particular that
of [Layer](http://layar.eu/). Not until the 3GS did the iphone have a compass
which is crucial for determining which direction the user is pointing. Even
still the iphone was not supposed to see any AR apps until the next release of
the iphone OS software - so yelp is being sneaky by releasing it early.
Hopefully they aren't angering the gods over at Apple.
