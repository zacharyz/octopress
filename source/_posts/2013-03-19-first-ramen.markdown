After finally arriving in Tokyo we set out to accomplish one of my
goals for the trip - to experience true Japanese Ramen.

Our hostel is based in the Asakusa district of Tokyo which is known for
it's famous temple - Sensoji. We set out to explore the area and 
stumbled upon an empty shop. I didn't expect much from it given it was
the first place that we encountered but thankfully I walked away after
having one of best ramen experiences of my life.

The shop itself was made up of only a few chairs and the two chefs. One
made the ramen while the other made the gyoza.
