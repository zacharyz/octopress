This picture represents a special memory for me. Not only was it an absolute
perfect night for photography but I also had a chance to take a picture of the
rare occurance of a [super moon](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/).

This is one of the final pictures I took after a day of touring London. By
this point my entire body was complaining and I still had an hour long walk
ahead of me back to my hostel. Despite the pain I was incredibly happy to be
doing what I was where I was doing it.

Tomorrow I leave on a cheap flight to spend the weekend in Paris - another
first for me. Thanks for viewing!
