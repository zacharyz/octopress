It isn't very often that I get shots of myself, thankfully my girlfriend was
willing to help me out. Her parents are visiting from Korea and love to hike
as much as I do so we decided to give Dog Mountain a chance despite the
promise of wet weather.

  
Dog Mountain is 3.8 mile trip to the top, and it is all up hill. When we got
to the top it was enveloped in a cloud so there wasn't much to look at.
Eventually there was a break in the clouds which revealed a spectacular view
of the gorge covered in wild flowers.
