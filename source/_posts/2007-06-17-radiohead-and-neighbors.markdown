Today marks the 10th anniversary of Radiohead's release of [OK
Computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer).

OK Computer was one of the first and only CDs I have ever bought. I knew who
Radiohead was before that album but it wasn't until Paranoid Android did I
really take notice of "mainstream" music. Ten years later and Radiohead is
still one of my favorite bands and is up there with the Smashing Pumpkins who
recently got back together again.

I hope to see them both in concert some day!

On another note my neighbors from hell finally moved today. No I didn't say
good-bye. I did get to see their ragged couches out by the dumpster. For a
moment I contemplated claiming them then I remembered how disgusting those two
were.

My room-mate moved out at the beginning of the month and took all his clutter
so I suddenly found myself with more room than I know what to do with. The
first thing I did was clean up the place. I discovered several surfaces that
were white that I wasn't aware of. I also converted the living room to my main
bedroom. Its really nice waking up to a nice view of the river with natural
lighting. Its a shame Bell are such complete cock whores otherwise I would
gladly live here.

Apartment Living is good once again, at least for the next few months.
