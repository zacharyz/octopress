Recently I stumbled upon a great exposure blending tutorial by photographer
David Clapp. He does a good job of going through the steps required to get a
shot that has a great dynamic range - so there is excellent detail both in the
highlights of the picture as well as the shadows. This effect is usually only
possible with the use of expensive Neutral Gradient filters, but David shows
how it is possible to achieve the same effect by blending together multiple
exposures in photoshop.

Be sure to check out David's
[tutorial](http://www.davidclapp.co.uk/exposureblending.php).

At a recent coast trip I grabbed several exposures of a sunset with the
intention of making an HDR image, but I didn't like the result generated by
the software. With David's tutorial I was able to produce the following image.

While it isn't the most interesting sunset, the final image does capture the
over all feel of the setting better than any of my individual exposures did by
themselves.
