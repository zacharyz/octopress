It looks like Canon has already made my S3 IS obsolete by announcing today the
[Canon S5 IS](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0705/07050703canons5is.asp). For
some reason they decided to skip the S4. I can't say I am very impressed with
the upgrade. For about $200 more you get 2 more mega pixels (not useful for
me), a larger LCD (meh they didn't improve the AVF), 1600 ISO (800 is almost
useless on the S3) and face detection. Additionally they included a little
feature that auto-focuses during continuous shots (pretty cool!). I think the
face detection is the only thing I would really want. For that price though I
would just pick up a used SLR.
