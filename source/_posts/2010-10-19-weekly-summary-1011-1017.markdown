## Summary

**4,147** calories under budget for the week. Lost **2 pounds** this week. 

Half way to my goal, with pretty consistent weight loss so far. I got as low
at 173 after a run but felt horrible because I hadn't eaten enough so I spent
the rest of the week refueling.

I hope to be under 170 2 weeks from now.
