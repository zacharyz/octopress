If you haven't noticed - [I love panoramas.](http://zaczadell.com/tag/panoramas/) I think they do a fantastic
job of capturing the feel of a location much better than any single picture
could and they aren't all that difficult to produce. Here is a quick tutorial
on the methods that I use to take awesome travel panoramas.

I generally rely on two primary methods for taking them - either with my big
dslr and photoshop or my iphone and a stitching app.

### DSLR, Photoshop and Optionally a Tripod

  
This is the more established method that I use when I want something that I
intend to either print out or blow up later. The method requires that I take
several pictures that slightly overlap with a wide angle lens. If I can I will
use my [tripod](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015MFTE4?ie=UTF8&tag=ftp0e-
20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0015MFTE4) that has a
[panning head](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UOCWUK?ie=UTF8&tag=ftp0e-2
0&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002UOCWUK) on it, which
allows me to take sharp shots with precise overlap.

When a tripod isn't available though I simply snap a bunch of pictures and
manually pan from left to right (or vica verca) across the scene.

Once you get the hang of it, the process takes only slightly longer than
taking a single shot. I tend to take 3-5 shots for every panorama.

The next step is to use photoshop's [photomerge](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/P
hotoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-75e8a.html) feature. You
give it a list of pictures and it will try and blend them together in a
meaningful way - usually a panorama.

### Iphone + autostitch app

  
I can't always have my camera + tripod with me but I will most likely have my
phone. For the cost of a cheap app (under $3 and totally worth every penny), I
can grab panoramas wherever I go. I use
[autostitch](http://www.cloudburstresearch.com/autostitch/autostitch.html).

This method won't yield the sharpest results but it will definitely be better
than nothing. The iphone's lens isn't very wide, so be sure to capture shots
both above and below the shots that make up your panorama. This will allow you
to take in some of the sky and ground. So instead of 3 shots you will end up
taking around 9. Autostich is a champ at combining everything together.

You can also use the same method to take
vertical shots aka vertoramas. This picture of Saint Peters Cathedral is made
up of 3 images taken while panning vertically. Despite having a very wide
angle lens (10mm) there is no other way I could have captured the entire
building from that position without using this method.

Thanks for reading and let me know if you want me to go into any greater
detail into what exactly is involved. Otherwise this should be enough to get
you started in taking awesome travel panoramas yourself.
