Spring is starting to peak it's head out from the rain and the snow here in Oregon. I
thought I would take advantage of the opportunity and spend the weekend at the coast
shooting Haystack Rock at Cannon Beach. 

The weather promised clear skies and warm weather (for Oregon Coast at least). Unfortunately I was cheated out of
a glorious sunset and instead had to settle for this. 

Despite my inactivity for posting pictures over the last 6 months - photography has still been on
my mind. The new year has brought about a ton of postive changes and I
am excited as ever to advantage of them.

Stay tuned for many more pictures to come in 2012.
