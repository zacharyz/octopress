I got to see the Decemberists for the first time in concert on Thursday with
my girlfriend. I have been listening to them for just over a year now but
wasn't very enthusiastic about their new stuff aside from a few songs.
Thankfully they sound a million times better live than they do recorded, which
is remarkable considering how awesome they usually sound.

Colin Meloy has an amazing voice and stage presence for a nerd. I couldn't
help but thinking while watching him perform that even nerds can be rock
stars.

They opened with Oceanside off their 5 songs album, which is one of my
favorite songs. Then they played their newer stuff with some chick from the
opening band singing the female part in Yankee Bayonet. She sounded a little
like Dido, which is a good thing, and put a softer edge to the song.

One of the things that I have grown to like about Eugene is that a lot of
artists that I like so much have roots out of Eugene. Meloy used to go to the
local university and the bassist used to work at one of the local music places
called the WoW theater before joining the band.

That girl playing the huge keyboard covered the rest of the female lyrics.

One of the highlights of the show was when Colin Meloy took a camera from
someone in the front row of the audience and started taking pictures of
himself and everyone in the band.

The main highlight though was The Mariner's Revenge Song which didn't happen
until they came back on for the obligatory encore. That was the song that got
me hooked into the indi-folk style that The Decemberists do so well.

Aside from being the first show I saw at the Macdonald theater it also gave me
an opportunity to play with my new camera in such a dark setting. Its a [Canon

considering I was on the balcony at the very back of the theater I think it
did an admirable job.
