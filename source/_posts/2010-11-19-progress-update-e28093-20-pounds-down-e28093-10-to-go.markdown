Those last 10 pounds took quite a bit longer than the first. Because of this I
almost feel like I have lost some perspective on how big a change it was for
me. My self image increased drastically going from 180-170. The first 10 were
rewarding but I couldn't really see the difference, with these last 10 it is
much more apparent.

I now have a BMI below 24.2, which means I am now at _normal weight_.

It was actually towards the end of October that I saw hints of being this low.
After major runs or tennis I would be in the low 170s. I figured with the way
I was going I would be in the 160s in no time. Then a couple of weeks ago (to
this day) I did something really dumb and ran on a strained ankle. Two weeks
later and that ankle is still hurting because of it. Then I went on a near
week long business trip that really tested my dieting resolve. Mid-way through
that I caught a cold - which I have spent the week fighting off. So the last
couple of weeks have put a major damper on my weight loss. I would guess the
last 3-4 pounds that I have lost have been exclusively because of dieting,
which is odd to me because I have relied so much on exercising for the first
16 pounds.

Today means I only have 8.8 pounds to go before I reach my goal of getting to
160. That number looks way smaller than 20 did a month and a half ago but it
looks huge when you consider that I will be attempting it by New Years -
especially during the holidays.

Part of my motivation for doing it before the New Year is so that I will be
able to go into the new year knowing that I am already at a good weight. So
instead of having to make yet another New Year's resolution of having to lose
weight I can make something else - like putting weight on (muscle), or even
just maintaining my weight.

Knowing how hard it was to lose these last 10 pounds makes me question if it
is even possible to lose another before the year ends with Thanksgiving and
Christmas coming up. We'll see how well that goes.
