I am a big fan of the game Starcraft - both playing it and watching pros
compete at it. The game has become a global phenominon since the
original was released in 1998. 

To get an idea of what it is like at the highest levels - picture the strategy of chess with the adrenaline producing rush of a wrestling match. No place appreciates the game more than South Korea - home of the best players in the world.

On March 12th Blizzard would be releasing the newest expansion to Starcraft 2.
To celebrate the Blizzard held a global launch event that began in Seoul and traversed the timezones for the next 24 hours. They gathered the top pros from Starcraft and Starcraft 2 and put them on stage to demonstrate the potential of the new expansion.

These players have been given nicknames by their fans such as God and
the Tyrant. They have legions of fan girls and are paid hundreds of
thousands of dollars each year by the largest companies in South Korea
all to compete at the highest level. 

It was an amazing opportunity to be at the Mecca of Starcraft and be
able to witness the birth of a new era for the game. After waiting in line with hundreds of other fans I was able to pick up one of the very first copies of the collector's edition sold in the world.
