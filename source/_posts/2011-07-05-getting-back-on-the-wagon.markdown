Last year I accomplished a huge goal by [losing 30 lbs in about 3
months](http://zadell.com/2010/progress-update-%E2%80%93-30-pounds-down/).
Then I followed it up by losing an additional 5 pounds which brought me to my
lowest weight since high-school. I both felt and looked great and the change
was noticeable by everyone who knew me. After that I went into maintenance
mode and returned to enjoying good food. The problem is I have apparently been
enjoying myself a little too much and have crossed what I consider to be my
weight _limit_.

Well it is time to get back on the wagon again. If my experience with weight
loss has taught me anything it is that weight loss is at least 80% diet, and I
know for a fact that I have been enjoying the good life when it comes to food
and beer a little bit too much.

During the past few months I haven't exactly been inactive. I [climbed a
mountain](http://zadell.com/2011/summiting-mount-hood/), [ran a
bunch](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5906528522/), and have been
playing more tennis. I feel stronger and healthier than ever so why I am I
freaking out? Because it all begins some where. Sure a 5-10 pounds of weight
gain isn't much but that is just the beginning. If I get comfortable with a
pound here and there then before I know it I will overweight, out of shape and
hating myself.

I have set a new goal for myself to lose 10 pounds. It isn't nearly as much as
last time but weight isn't everything. This isn't about maintenance any longer
but instead prevention.

I'll be recording my progress using [loseit.com](http://www.loseit.com/) and
the related iphone app. If anyone wants to join along then feel free to friend
me. My plan is to rein in control of my diet. I don't think I can give up
eating good food completely (I don't hate myself that much). What I do need to
do is to eat smaller portions. So instead of 20 delicious wings of King's
Wings I will instead order ~6.

time I dieted my most recorded food was ice cream. The key for me then was
instead of eating the entire pint I would only eat a single serving at a time
(~200 calories).

For me the most effective way to lose weight is to be accountable and
conscious of what I am doing. This is why I love using loseit because if you
are being honest with yourself then you can see exactly what you are doing. If
you are consistently over budget then of course the weight isn't going to come
off. At the same time you are sharing your progress (or lack of) with your
friends who can then share in your success when you do reach your goals.

Bring on the six-pack abs please.
