Located about 2 miles into the Eagle Creek trail in the Columbia River Gorge.

  
The water level is so high this time of year that you can't view these falls
from the lower level without getting really wet and I didn't want to risk my
gear. This is unfortunate because the falls looked amazing. The last time I
had a chance to get out here it was right before winter, so the water level
was much lower.

  
Eagle Creek in general is fantastic right now and is a Waterfall Wonderland
with tons of beautiful tiny waterfalls pouring out along the trail.
