My good buddy Craig and I made an impromptu trip out to Jefferson Park. He
lives down in Eugene and I live in Portland so we decided to meet in
midway.

A sixish mile hike opens up to a lake filled meadow below the Oregon's
2nd largest mountain - <a href="http://web.oregon.com/hiking/jefferson_park.cfm">Jefferson</a>.

We woke up at 1:30am to a perfectly clear sky with the milky-way arching
over our heads.
