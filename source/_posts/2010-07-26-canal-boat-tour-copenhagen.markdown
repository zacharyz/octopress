(http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4821608361/) On one our final nights in
Copenhagen we decided to finally give in and try out one of the canal tours.
At this point there wasn't any part of the tour that we hadn't already seen,
so this gave me an advantage in terms of what to expect. It also meant I could
really relax and enjoy the tour.

(http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4821610209/) The tour began just as the
sun began to set, so we had some great lighting, but for the first time since
we arrived we also got to experience cool weather here.

into an upscale apartment complex.

935/) According to the guide this is the most photographed tree in Copenhagen
as everyone takes a picture of it while trying to get a shot of the church as
it comes into view.
