In the past I haven't usually considered a butcher when shopping for proteins.
It has always been something that I have known that I _should_ be doing but
the convenience of getting meat from a grocery store is often too great.
Recently I have been experimenting with our local butcher to see just how much
better locally grown protein can be. Bacon at Safeway costs about 4.50 for a
package, and for about the same price you can get a pound at the butcher.

To say that bacon from the butcher is better is an understatement. Not only is
it leaner but it is so much more delicious. Don't let the fattiness of that
first picture fool you, when this stuff is cooked most of the fat goes away
and you are left with _pure bacon joy_.
