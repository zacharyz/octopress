Those who live in Eugene know that the place is situated between two buttes.
The closest located in northern Eugene is Skinner's butte (who principle
Skinner on the Simpsons get his name from) and the other located on the
southern end called Spencer's Butte. Spencer's is more of a hike while the
other has a fun rock climbing face.

Last weekend Brett, Craig and I decided to enjoy the weather and hit up
Spencer's for a quick hike and hopefully make it fast enough to catch the
sunset from atop the butte. We also used the chance to play with our cameras.
Brett has a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi so I was pretty interested in how my
"super zoom" camera would compare in the lighting conditions.

Right off the back Brett's camera was able to take better shots of Craig and I
than I have him.

All my shots of him came out blurry due to the lighting and our movement.

The conditions were a lot muddier than I had ever experienced before I prior
hikes, but otherwise it was a fun hike. I managed to catch a lot of "sun
behind the branches" shots. I think mine turned out nicer over all than
Brett's.

We arrived at the top to find a few people already there. The "seal" that
marked the top of the butte was removed and in its place was a tree branch
that was ideal for steadying our cameras.

There was a bunch of birds flying about, which gave me a good opportunity to
test out my zoom against moving targets.

I was able to get in pretty close and see that what I first thought were
hawks, were in fact buzzards.

Of course we took a bunch of shots of the sunset and surrounding scenery.

I grabbed this next shot on our way back down. Craig had thought it would make
a good shot. Brett's version had actually turned out washed out with very
little detail and the surrounding trees black.

The trip down was actually a lot of fun. Rather than go the way we came we
were recommended by a fellow hiker to go down the other side, which was far
steeper but would eventually meet up with our original path. The steepness
combined with the mud made for a lot of moments where we were skiing down the
slopes.

Overall it made for a pleasant evening hike that provided some great exercise
and photos.
