Coming from Eugene I am not used to local bands sounding good. They have the
instruments, and know how to play them but the end result usually isn't all
that great. It is funny because a lot of really good bands have come out of
Eugene, but at some point the music scene decided to move to Portland. So with
some trepidation I agreed to catch a live show from a friend's band, not
expecting much. If nothing else at least it would give me a chance hang out
with friends and try some music photography.

Thankfully the band - [Love Lies Dying](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Love-
Lies-Dying/130327486451) - was actually quite good. The show took place at the
[Ash Street Saloon](http://www.ashstreetsaloon.com/).

  
I was tempted to just sit back the entire time and just enjoy the show, but I
noticed that no one else was really taking pictures. My D90 is a good camera,
but when it comes to the kind of low light photography that most music
photography demands - well there is a lot left to be desired. If I were going
to try and make an honest living out of this sort of thing I would definitely
want a full frame camera like a Nikon D700 or a Canon 5d mk II. Regardless I
am a strong believer in working with the tools that I have, so with that in
mind I threw on my fastest lens and decided to test a few shots - only to find
a blurry mess. I tried again with a flash and found the results were clear but
the flash had washed out the ambient stage lighting.

I was just about ready to give up when I got inspired by the work of a flickr
contact of mine named Todd who runs the site
[ishootshows](http://ishootshows.com/). I actually fired up the flickr app on
my iphone and started browsing his
[stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddowyoung/) to pump myself up. I am
not going to pretend to be able to take as good of shots as Todd, but I wasn't
going to leave the show without giving it a second try.

In the end I had a great time and the band appreciated me shooting the show.
The lessons I learned: take lots of shots, at least some are bound to be clear
and make heavy use of Lightroom's Luminance Noise Reduction.
