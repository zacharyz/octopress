It has been just about a day since I completed my first international flight
and arrived in Copenhagen.

My flight took me from Portland -> Seattle -> Reykjavik -> Copenhagen.

I have always wanted to go to Iceland, unfortunately for this trip I could
only stay there for an hour. With customs, my stay there felt even shorter.

Landing in Denmark provided a much better view.

Navigating through the Copenhagen airport was a painless experience. They
didn't even bother to check our passports upon arriving. This is truly the
land of freakishly tall vikings.

From the airport we rode a train to get to our apartment.

My initial impression of Copenhagen is just how clean and impressive the city
is. The streets were filled with people on bicycles - way more than were ever
in Portland.

If there was ever any need for further proof of what a simple creature I am
then just look at the beer that my girlfriend picked out for me without
asking. Despite not being able to read a word, she was able to pick out what
is now my favorite beer. Apparently juice + beer is delicious.

We didn't fall asleep until well past midnight local time which is about a 9
hour time difference from Portland. It didn't get dark till around 10:30. At
4:30 in the morning I was woken up by light pouring into our windows.

I am now exhausted after spending the day in the office and surviving off of
around 5 cups of coffee.

Stay tuned for more!
