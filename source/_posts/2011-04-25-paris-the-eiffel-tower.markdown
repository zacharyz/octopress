The weather in Paris didn't quite work out for me. I had planned on spending
the evening photographing the city at night only to find myself in a race to
stay dry while still getting _some_ shots of the iconic tower. I had gone on a
3 hour tour the city after exploring the Louvre and was exhausted at this
point. I only had enough time to grab a few shots and ask some friendly
tourists to grab some shots of myself before the sky opened up and drenched
everyone.

Oddly enough I met a ton of awesome Spanish people on this trip. I stayed in a
cheap hostel that had mixed dorms and ended up rooming with college-aged
Spanish girls. On the tour I ended up also meeting a bunch of guys from
Barcelona and Madrid. Their friendliness definitely convinced me to add Spain
to my future travels.

One of my goals for this trip was to travel as light as possible (while still
carrying my camera + lenses). I ended up not bringing my laptop or tripod and
wearing exclusively my vibram five fingers. The other tourists really got a
kick out of my vffs.

During one point in the trip I was sprinting between metros trying to make it
to my flight on time. A friendly French dude ended up leading me Parkour-style
over the ticket stalls and showing me how to avoid getting caught in the
process. Overall the French that I encountered left a really good impression
on me.
