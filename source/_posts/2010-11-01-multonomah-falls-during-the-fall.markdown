The Gorge is absolutely stunning right now. The water levels are high and the
trees are filled with oranges and yellows. If you can find a dry enough day as
I was lucky enough to this weekend then you need to do yourself a favor and
make your way out there before all the color disappears.

This was my first hike in my Vibram Five Finger Trek shoes and it was a
breeze. They handled the rocky uphill climb with ease and were still
comfortable after I waded into the cold water to get the shots that I wanted.

It was good to see a healthy amount of photographers out with tripods (I
counted about ten). I don't think people realize how much better their
waterfall shots will be if they use one as it is nearly impossible to get a
sharp shot that has that silky water effect that can only be achieved by
having a shot that is exposed for 1-2 seconds. One guy had a $3000 camera and
was convinced he didn't need to use my tripod when I offered it because he
felt that his expensive camera would be enough.
