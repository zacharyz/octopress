While shopping at the local Korean food store I stumbled upon what may be the
greatest candy ever. Its made by a Japanese company named Kasugai. The candy
is simply called "gami" or gummy. So the two I have here are Grape and Litchi
Gummy.

They come in multiple flavors - so far I have tried Litchi, Grape, and
Strawberry and all three have tasted very much like the actual fruits.

While they aren't exactly healthy, they are 100% oishii desune.
