We decided to try something different this year for the 4th. Instead of
attending a fireworks show we decided to camp out on the roof of my apartment.
There were scheduled to be three major fireworks shows and ideally they would
all be visible from my roof. In total we had 6 people up there enjoying drinks
and company.

I really wanted to use the opportunity to experiment with taking pictures of
fireworks. Up until this point I hadn't experimented with the different
exposure settings on my camera nor had many opportunities to play with my
tripod.

The main obstacle was getting people on the roof. There aren't exactly stairs
leading to the top. Instead you usually have to splinter-cell split step
between two walls until you get to the roof. This is fine for guys who rock
climb a lot but not for our girlfriends :/.

We ended up stacking some objects to make it easier. My girl was a great sport
about the whole thing even though I could tell it terrified her to be up
there.

When the fireworks started we were initially let down. Most of the fireworks
were below tree level and were barely visible from our position. We were close
to leaving when the big ones started. ![](http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/RoyG3

From there it only got better. Having the tripod really help in developing
what ended up being 2 second long exposures per firework. One of the cool
things about the shots is that you can see the sky gradually get darker. ![](h

was disappointing. It ended only 7 minutes after it was scheduled to start.
But over all everyone had a great time and I got around 75 shots to show for
it.
