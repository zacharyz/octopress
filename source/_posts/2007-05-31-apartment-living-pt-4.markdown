The good news is that my neighbors that I hate so much are moving out in June.
The bad news is that my lease is almost up and due to Bell Realty, the
apartment's new management, I am 99% certain I won't be renewing.

In April Bell sent out these letters asking if you wanted to renew the lease.
That's 4 months before the lease ended. If you didn't agree to renew they
immediately put your place up on their site advertising its available.

I called up Bell and explained why I wasn't willing to immediately renew
because the place had basically been lived in constantly since 2001 without
being cleaned once. So the only way I was going to renew the lease there was
if they replaced all the carpets and appliances and cleaned up the place. They
agreed to this with the only issue being that I move out for 2 weeks while
they did the cleaning. This wasn't a problem because I could just move my
stuff next store into my friend's place while they did the cleaning. Only
apparently they had leased out my friend's place while he was still in it.

That's right. 4 months left and they had already leased the place to someone
else. To make matters worse its the girls who live directly below him. When he
asked Bell "Wtf?" they responded that he couldn't apply for the same apartment
that he lived in. Swell.

At this point we weren't exactly thrilled. The main draw of living in such a
shitty apartment was that I was living next to a good friend and co-worker. If
he is getting the boot then the place isn't nearly as attractive. Additionally
I wouldn't be able to stay at his place while they cleaned.

So we wrote back Bell and tried to reason with them how it was ridiculous to
expect someone to commit 4 months in advance to renewing a lease. We even went
so far as to say that if my friend wasn't allowed to renew then I wouldn't be
renewing either. Two weeks past before we got a reply. Apparently the girl we
were in contact with decided to go on vacation and during that time the girls
who applied to the place had given their deposit. Her reply? Tough shit.

So it looks like I have two months to find a new place because at this point
there is no way I am willing to give these fucks anymore money.

Word to the wise: Stay clear of Bell Realty.
