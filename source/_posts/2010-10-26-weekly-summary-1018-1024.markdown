## Summary

  
**2,572 calories** under budget for the week. Lost **1.8 pounds** this week.  
Nothing magical happened this week. Still making steady progress, and in a
week or two I will begin to dip into the 160s for the first time. I am now
firmly half way towards my goal and can visibly tell that I am making
progress.

On the running front I have been shaving off minutes on my 4 mile times. Today
alone I ran my fastest mile and my fastest 4 mile pace since I started running
again. I am slowly moving towards running at a 9 min/mile pace. There are
times when I really enjoy running and it feels like I am flying through my
route thanks to my vibram five fingers.
