One of the highlights since moving to Portland has been making a ton of
new friends. Two of the earliest that Seyoung and I made were Chris and
Melissa.

Originally we had all planned on spending the weekend clamming in
Washington but when the weather got hostile they decided to hold and
impromptu dinner and invite all our friends over. Chris and Melissa have
traveled around vietnam and studied asian cuisine so we were all in for
a treat.

Chris' job was to handle cooking all the meat while Melissa was in
charge of the ice cream. Everyone else was put on the duty of
constructing all the different courses.
