## Summary

**1838** calories under budget for the week. Lost **2.8 pounds** this week.  
Another strong week and I did it even while indulging in a delicious
Thanksgiving Dinner. You will notice a small uptick on my weight loss graph
thanks to turkey.

I have been very strict when it comes to obeying my calorie budget and so far
the pounds have been flying off. I begin the new week at 164 lbs leaving just
4 more pounds to go before I reach my goal.

I have found that green tea has been my greatest weapon towards managing any
food cravings. Combine that with smaller food portions over all and it has
made weight loss seem easy.

At the beginning of the year I set a goal of getting down to 165 and it feels
good to complete yet another goal for the year. I am still determined to reach
my goal of losing 30 pounds over all though.

For the last couple of weeks I have been sick and am slowly recovering from my
ankle injury that has prevented me from exercising. I hope that this is the
final week that I will have to deal with either issue.

Just 4 pounds left - I can do this!
