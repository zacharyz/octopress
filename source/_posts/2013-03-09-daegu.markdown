Daegu is the birthplace of my fiance (who took the above picture). When I first met her 6 years ago
we didn't think we would ever have the opportunity to visit her hometown. 

Over the years I built up an expectation for Daegu. To listen to people describe it - Daegu is a back
country town filled with uninteresting people and little to do. My
experience was pretty far from this. Maybe it is because Seoul is a
gigantic, crowded and bustling city and in comparison to that just about any other city in the
world is small. Daegu though for me was a wonderful change of pace.
Everyone we encountered was warm, welcoming and helpful. Growing up in
Hawaii and living in Portland I am perhaps more accustomed to a slower
pace to life than what Seoul offered. Daegu felt way more livable.
