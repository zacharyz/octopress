I visited Seoraksan (a mountain in South Korea) in March during my
3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.

South Korea for me was dominated by pollution and smog that drifted from the
neighboring China, as a result this picture has a fogginess to it. What
isn't captured is just how windy it was there - I at several points
nearly lost my glasses.

Seoraksan is the sort of place that I will most certainly have to visit
again at some point in my life. Picture monk filled temples over-looking
crystal clear mountain streams in the mountains and you get an idea of
how awesome and peaceful a place it is.
