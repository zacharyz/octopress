I woke up Saturday morning in a London hostel and then proceeded to spend the
next 10 hours touring the city - mostly on foot. The entire time I lugged
around my tripod wondering if I should have left the thing at home.

Then the sun set and I was treated to London at night in the form of
[Trafalagar Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square) making my
sore shoulders and feet worth it.
