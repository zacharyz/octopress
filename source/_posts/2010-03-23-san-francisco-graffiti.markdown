A couple of weeks ago I had an opportunity to go down to the bay area for a
photography gig while attending the Game Developers Conference. There is a lot
that I love about the Bay Area - in particular I love the start-up tech vibe
that everyone seems to bleed down there.

Unfortunately the area of San Francisco that I was at wasn't very inspiring.
Coming from Portland, that part of town was extremely dirty and filled with
crazy people. One morning I passed a girl yelling at a closed shop door, when
she didn't get a response she moved on to a wall to continue her yelling.

One thing that did catch my eye though was the bizarre graffiti that seemed to
highlight every back alley that I passed.

I still hope to move down there some day, but not that part of town.
