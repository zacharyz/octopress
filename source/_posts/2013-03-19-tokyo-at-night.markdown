The view from Tokyo Tower observatory.

Tripods were not allowed up here so I got these shots by creatively
propping up my camera against the glass of the windows. I used my coat
to block out reflections. 

I really appreciated the blade-runner like view and reflections of the
traffic in the building windows.
