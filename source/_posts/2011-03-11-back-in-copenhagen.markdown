I am spending a month working in Copenhagen.

The weather here isn't exactly pleasant. The strange combination of cold,
wind, rain and snow means I am not spending much time outdoors. On my walks to
and from work I am bundled up and am amazed to see people going for jogs or
riding their bikes without their face or heads covered while it is raining and
freezing.

My time here has actually been healthier than usual despite being in a foreign
country. I chalk this up to two factors: 1) My apartment/hotel has a clean
pool and decent weight room 2) the food here is pretty lackluster. Combine
those traits with the craptastic weather and I have yet to really leave my
apartment except to go to work.

I feel zero desire to eat out because everything is bland and over priced and
I am working out and swimming every day. Food wise I have been following a
slow-carb diet which does away with carbs like sugars, pastas and breads. So
it is mostly vegetables and proteins. My most common meal has been eggs, beans
and some frozen vegetables. Yummy.

At the office we get catered lunches. Everyone always complains about the
quality but it is a perk that I definitely appreciate and don't get to take
advantage of because I work remotely. There is just enough variety that I
don't have to deviate from my diet.

I plan to spend my first weekend here decompressing from a busy but productive
week of work by mostly reading on my kindle. The weather is going to be decent
- at least rain and snow isn't on the forecast. I hope to be able to get out
and grab some more pictures or chill in a cafe some place.

The upcoming weekends should be more interesting though. So far I have booked
weekend trips to London and Paris. It will be my first time traveling to
either place. Both flights have me leaving Friday after work and returning
Sunday night. Once you are in Europe it is pretty remarkable where you can
travel to for 100-200 bucks.
