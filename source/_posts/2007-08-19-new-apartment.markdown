My buddies Sam and Brett helped me move into my new place yesterday. It
was such a good feeling walking away from that old apartment, which was a such
a huge dump. I refused to do any cleaning to the place beyond picking up my
trash, so good luck trying to clean that place Bell.

Initially I had considered hiring some people to do the move for me. I found a
bidding service that lets you set the amount you want to pay, and then people
bid for the right to move your stuff. I figured it would be like ebay, where
you set your max bid and it doesn't go higher than that. Unfortunately bidding
started at my max, which was set unreasonably high, and the best bids were
never low enough. So we rented a uhaul instead, $50 later and our stuff was
moved.

The new place is amazing. Aside from having more room, it also has a better
layout, a deck, a garage (made unpacking so much easier), and a yard. Best of
all though is the location. The location of my last apartment was its best
feature. But this place does a good job of competing. Like the old place this
one has a Market of Choice near by, but this one is much bigger and feels a
lot nicer. Additionally there is a Wal-mart, Cafe Yum, and a ton of other
places to eat and drink at (no bars though). I think my favorite thing though,
which I only found out after I decided to live here, is that the swim and
tennis club is about 4 blocks from my door. That's closer than the University
was to my old place. What's incredible about all this is that the place is
very quiet compared to my old apartment despite being so close to so many
things.
