I turned 30 last month.

On September 1st I weighed myself for the first time in weeks and found myself
at 190 lbs. At 5'10" that means I have a BMI of 27.3, which by that measure is
considered overweight.

I have a medium build so BMI doesn't mean a whole lot to me, but at the same
time I am personally not happy with how my body looks or with my level of
fitness. The purpose of this site is to motivate me to achieving the level of
fitness that I desire. By publishing my diets and exercises I am holding
myself accountable.

_My personal challenge then is to lose 30 lbs - or weigh 160 lbs - within the
year. _

I plan to post weekly status reports on my progress. I also plan to document
the methods and diets that I used to achieve the results.
