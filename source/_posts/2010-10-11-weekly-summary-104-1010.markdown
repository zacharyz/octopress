### Summary

**2,270 calories** under budget for the week. Lost **2 pounds** this week.  
This week was surprising in that I managed to lose weight despite exercising
less. During a run early in the week my left calf cramped up and popped, which
as you can imagine was quite alarming. That was enough to tell me to listen to
my body and to take it easy for the rest of the week. This week I don't plan
on going running every day like I have been to give my body some time to
repair itself. I will be attending more jiu jitsu though and doing more kettle
bell training.

Almost half-way there!
