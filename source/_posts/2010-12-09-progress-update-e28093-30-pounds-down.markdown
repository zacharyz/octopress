I was actually confused this morning when I looked at my scale. I was
expecting to see 161 or 162 and hadn't expected to lose that last pound for
another few days. Coming back from my last trip where I was consistently
hovering just barely over 170 - loseit kept predicting my completion date as
getting ever closer to the end of the year. This made me think more and more
than it was unreasonable to lose 30 pounds in the time frame I wanted.

This past week I have had only one thing in mind with regards to my diet - eat
whatever I wanted to as long as I was under budget.
Loseit lists ice-cream as one of my favorite foods. This shows me that a large part of losing
weight is really about managing _how much_ you eat.

For the first few months I ran and exercised like a mad man, which made me
feel great. Then when I was injured I didn't have the luxury of knowing that I
would be able to eat those 400-600 more calories thanks to my run. Loading up
on calories can be incredibly easy - a bag of chips, some ice-cream, eating
out. Bam - you just consumed more calories than your body can burn. So the
important thing for me was learning to manage my portions and how much I ate.

Now comes another challenge - not putting it all back on again.

My ankle is beginning to feel good enough to run on again and I am starting to
do more body weight exercises. I no doubt lost _some_ muscle over the last
year and half where I didn't lift consistently so a part of me wants to try
and put that back on.

For now though I am thrilled to be going into the New Year knowing that I was
able to actually accomplish a weight loss goal.
