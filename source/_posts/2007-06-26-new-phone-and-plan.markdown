After 2 years of being on Cingular I finally got sick of them raping me in the
ass and switched to a new phone service. What should have cost about $30 a
month was on average $60 a month due to BS charges by Cingular particularly
for worthless insurance, charging out the ass for using data, and text
messages.

I had the option to wait around for the Iphone but decided it wasn't worth the
price and to be with Cingular any longer. I also shopped around a bit for what
other carriers were offering and was pretty disappointed when a friend turned
me on to [Sprint's SERO plan](http://www.fatwallet.com/t/18/680568/).

What you get with SERO:

  * Unlimited Sprint Vision or Power Vision (data/interweb)
  * Unlimited Text Messages
  * Unlimited Mobile to Mobile
  * Unlimited Sprint Picture Mail
  * Unlimited Roaming
  * 500 anytime minutes 
  * Unlimited Nights & Weekends (Starts @ 7PM)
  * Nationwide Long Distance
  * Crystal Clear Calls
  * Voice Mail
  * Caller ID
  * Call Waiting
  * Numeric Paging
  * Three-Way Calling
What does this all cost? $30. Yep, for half of what I was paying before I get
unlimited data and text messaging.

I ended up going with the [Moto
Q](http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/q/q-experience/q.html) for my new
phone. Its a window mobile 5 smart phone with a qwerty keyboard that is super
thin. After rebates the phone is practically free.

I am not totally sold on the phone just yet (I have 30 days to decide) but so
far it seems great. I love being able to browse the web and check my email
wherever I am. Windows mobile 5 sucks, but thats another story.

I made a trip with my girl last weekend and google maps was a life saver
navigating around Portland.

So if you are unhappy with your current phone plan or in the market for a new
one I whole heartedly recommend Sprint's SERO plan.
