## Summary

  
**4,897 calories under budget for the week.** **Lost 3.6 pounds this week.**  
This weeks gains have been in large part due to getting a pair of Vibram Five
Fingers which have contributed to my desire to run a lot more. I also played a
lot more tennis this past week than I usually do thanks to some decent
weather.

Getting down to 180 means I have hit my first milestone - I have lost 10
pounds!
