[Castle Rosenborg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenborg_Castle) is located in the
center of Copenhagen. It is surrounded by a nice park, called The King's
Garden, that people go to during the day for picnics and to relax.

As far as castles go, it is actually quite small and the real highlight is
that the crown jewels reside here.

Chi took us on a tour of this castle to give
us a taste of Danish history. I purchased an additional pass that let me take
pictures inside.

The castle is filled with tapestries, intricate clocks, detailed ceilings,
busts of royalty and paintings galore.

This was actually the King's toilet and was located quite a bit aways from the throne room.

One of the highlights was when a guy who looked like Peter Griffen got all
huffy when I accidentally fell on a chair while trying to frame a shot around
him.

The guy in this tapestry seemed to contrast with the rest of the imagery.

After throne room we headed down to the real _gem_ of the tour - the royal
treasure vault.
