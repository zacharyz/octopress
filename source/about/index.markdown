### Who is this guy?

My name is Zachary Zadell.

I am a software developer based out of Portland, Oregon. I work for a
local startup called [Appfog](http://appfog.com/). 

I specialize in full-stack web development with Ruby, Javascript and CSS using primarily Ruby on Rails.

I began 2010 with a move to Portland, Oregon after living in Eugene for 5
years. I studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and
University of Hawaii at Manoa where I earned a degree in Computer Science. In
the past I have worked professionally as a project manager, game developer,
systems engineer and fruit picker in a rain-forest. Feel free to visit my
[Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyz) profile for more information.

### What is this site about?

I see this as a place where I can talk about the places I have been, the
lessons I have learned, the projects I am developing, and post pictures. Lots
of pictures.

I use photography as an excuse to go on hikes or travel to crazy locations
for the purpose of capturing unique perspectives that hopefully others can
appreciate. Photography forces you to actively look at and appreciate your
surroundings - something most people don't do enough.

I also am quite into playing tennis and improving my over all health and fitness. I dedicate a lot of time towards working out, running and trying to eat cleanly.


### About this site

This site is done with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/). 

The design is [responsive](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/) - meaning it will look decent on any sort of
device I display it on, whether that be my iphone or my desktop. It also puts an emphasis on my pictures more
than anything else - which is important to me.
