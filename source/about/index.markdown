My name is Zachary Zadell.

I am a software developer based out of Portland, Oregon.

I specialize in full-stack web development with Ruby, Javascript and CSS using primarily Ruby on Rails and Wordpress.

I began 2010 with a move to Portland, Oregon after living in Eugene for 5
years. I studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and
University of Hawaii at Manoa where I earned a degree in Computer Science. In
the past I have worked professionally as a project manager, game developer,
systems engineer and fruit picker in a rain-forest. Feel free to visit my
[Linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyz) for more information.

### What is this site about?

I see this as a place where I can talk about the places I have been, the
lessons I have learned, the projects I am developing, and post pictures. Lots
of pictures.

I use photography as an excuse to go on hikes or traveling to crazy locations
for the purpose of capturing unique perspectives that hopefully others can
appreciate.

When not working, taking pictures or hiking you will probably find me playing
tennis or running.
