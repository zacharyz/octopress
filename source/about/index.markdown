<p>My name is Zachary Zadell.</p>

<p>I am a software developer and photographer based out of Portland, Oregon. </p>

<p>I work for a local startup called <a href="http://www.appfog.com">AppFog</a> where we build tools
and products for like minded developers. There I am one of the primary developers on our application console, marketing sites and add-ons program. In June of 2013 we were <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/virtualization/centurylink-acquires-appfog-offer-multicloud-paas-221307">acquired</a> by a big company.</p>

<p>My weapons of choice are Ruby and Javascript using primarily Ruby on Rails and
more recently Express and Node.js.</p>

<p>Prior to life as a web developer I spent about 5 years working in the
game industry at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GarageGames">GarageGames</a> who was successfully acquired by IAC. There I worked on a variety of games, engines and projects with a focus on advanced graphics, physics, artificial intelligence and particle systems.</p>

<p>I moved to Portland in 2010 and have since fallen in love with local
microbrews, food carts and minimalist running. </p>

<p>I see this site as a place where I can talk about the places I have been, the
lessons I have learned, the projects I am developing, and post pictures. Lots
of pictures.</p>

<p>I studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and
University of Hawaii at Manoa where I earned a degree in Computer Science. In
the past I have worked professionally as a project manager, game developer,
systems engineer and fruit picker in a rain-forest. Feel free to visit my
