My name is Zachary Zadell.

I am a software developer and photographer based out of Portland, Oregon. 

I work for a local startup called [Appfog](http://appfog.com/) where we build tools
and products for like minded developers. There I am one of the primary developers on our application console, marketing sites and add-ons program. In June of 2013 we were [acquired](http://www.infoworld.com/d/virtualization/centurylink-acquires-appfog-offer-multicloud-paas-221307) by a big company.

I specialize in full-stack web development with Ruby, Javascript and CSS using primarily Ruby on Rails and
more recently Express and Node.js.

Prior to life as a web developer I spent about 5 years working in the
game industry at [GarageGames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GarageGames) who was successfully acquired by IAC. There I worked on a variety of games, engines and projects with a focus on advanced graphics, physics and particle systems.

I moved to Portland in 2010 and have since fallen in love with local
microbrews, food carts and minimalist running. 

I see this site as a place where I can talk about the places I have been, the
lessons I have learned, the projects I am developing, and post pictures. Lots
of pictures.

I studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and
University of Hawaii at Manoa where I earned a degree in Computer Science. In
the past I have worked professionally as a project manager, game developer,
systems engineer and fruit picker in a rain-forest. Feel free to visit my
