My name is Zachary Zadell.

I am a software developer and photographer based out of Portland, Oregon. 

I work for a local startup called [Appfog](http://appfog.com/) where we build tools
and products for like minded developers.

I specialize in full-stack web development with Ruby, Javascript and CSS using primarily Ruby on Rails and
more recently Node.js.

I moved to Portland in 2010 and have since fallen in love with local
microbrews, foodcarts and minimalist running. 

I see this site as a place where I can talk about the places I have been, the
lessons I have learned, the projects I am developing, and post pictures. Lots
of pictures.

I studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and
University of Hawaii at Manoa where I earned a degree in Computer Science. In
the past I have worked professionally as a project manager, game developer,
systems engineer and fruit picker in a rain-forest. Feel free to visit my
[Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyz) profile for more information.
