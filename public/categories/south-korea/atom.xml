<p>I am a big fan of the game Starcraft - both playing it and watching pros
compete at it. The game has become a global phenominon since the
original was released in 1998.</p>

<p>To get an idea of what it is like at the highest levels - picture the strategy of chess with the adrenaline producing rush of a wrestling match. No place appreciates the game more than South Korea - home of the best players in the world.</p>

<p>On March 12th Blizzard would be releasing the newest expansion to Starcraft 2.
To celebrate the Blizzard held a global launch event that began in Seoul and traversed the timezones for the next 24 hours. They gathered the top pros from Starcraft and Starcraft 2 and put them on stage to demonstrate the potential of the new expansion.</p>

<p>These players have been given nicknames by their fans such as God and
the Tyrant. They have legions of fan girls and are paid hundreds of
thousands of dollars each year by the largest companies in South Korea
all to compete at the highest level.</p>

<p>It was an amazing opportunity to be at the Mecca of Starcraft and be
able to witness the birth of a new era for the game. After waiting in line with hundreds of other fans I was able to pick up one of the very first copies of the collector's edition sold in the world.</p>

<p>Ddeokbokki is one of the first Korean dishes that Seyoung taught me.
Whenever she is sick and needs something spicy and comforting I make it
for her. It is simply made up of rice cakes, fish cakes, vegetables and
a chilli paste based sauce.</p>

<p>Before coming to Korea I had no idea just how common a dish it
is. Just about everywhere we went it could be found on street corners
sold by vendors. It is also pretty cheap - a typical meal costs about
$3 and was enough to feed two. At the end of a busy day of sight seeing we would find a random street vendor who would serve it with a warm cup of broth and eat it with tooth picks.</p>

<p>Daegu is the birthplace of my fiance (who took the above picture). When I first met her 6 years ago
we didn't think we would ever have the opportunity to visit her hometown.</p>

<p>Over the years I built up an expectation for Daegu. To listen to people describe it - Daegu is a back
country town filled with uninteresting people and little to do. My
experience was pretty far from this. Maybe it is because Seoul is a
gigantic, crowded and bustling city and in comparison to that just about any other city in the
world is small. Daegu though for me was a wonderful change of pace.
Everyone we encountered was warm, welcoming and helpful. Growing up in
Hawaii and living in Portland I am perhaps more accustomed to a slower
pace to life than what Seoul offered. Daegu felt way more livable.</p>

<p>I visited Palgongsan while visiting family in Daegu South Korea in March during my 3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>This was yet another example of a landscape dominated by the haze from
pollution from China. To get here you take a beautiful ride up in a
cable car that seems designed to appeal to young lovers.</p>

<p>I visited Seoraksan (a mountain in South Korea) in March during my
3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>South Korea for me was dominated by pollution and smog that drifted from the
neighboring China, as a result this picture has a fogginess to it. What
isn't captured is just how windy it was there - I at several points
nearly lost my glasses.</p>

<p>Seoraksan is the sort of place that I will most certainly have to visit
again at some point in my life. Picture monk filled temples over-looking
crystal clear mountain streams in the mountains and you get an idea of
how awesome and peaceful a place it is.</p>
