<p>Ddeokbokki is one of the first Korean dishes that Seyoung taught me.
Whenever she is sick and needs something spicy and comforting I make it
for her. It is simply made up of rice cakes, fish cakes, vegetables and
a chilli paste based sauce.</p>

<p>Before coming to Korea I had no idea just how common a dish it
is. Just about everywhere we went it could be found on street corners
sold by vendors. It is also pretty cheap - a typical meal costs about
$3 and was enough to feed two. At the end of a busy day of sight seeing we would find a random street vendor who would serve it with a warm cup of broth and eat it with tooth picks.</p>

<p>Daegu is the birthplace of my fiance (who took the above picture). When I first met her 6 years ago
we didn't think we would ever have the opportunity to visit her hometown.</p>

<p>Over the years I built up an expectation for Daegu. To listen to people describe it - Daegu is a back
country town filled with uninteresting people and little to do. My
experience was pretty far from this. Maybe it is because Seoul is a
gigantic, crowded and bustling city and in comparison to that just about any other city in the
world is small. Daegu though for me was a wonderful change of pace.
Everyone we encountered was warm, welcoming and helpful. Growing up in
Hawaii and living in Portland I am perhaps more accustomed to a slower
pace to life than what Seoul offered. Daegu felt way more livable.</p>

<p>I visited Palgongsan while visiting family in Daegu South Korea in March during my 3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>This was yet another example of a landscape dominated by the haze from
pollution from China. To get here you take a beautiful ride up in a
cable car that seems designed to appeal to young lovers.</p>

<p>I visited Seoraksan (a mountain in South Korea) in March during my
3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>South Korea for me was dominated by pollution and smog that drifted from the
neighboring China, as a result this picture has a fogginess to it. What
isn't captured is just how windy it was there - I at several points
nearly lost my glasses.</p>

<p>Seoraksan is the sort of place that I will most certainly have to visit
again at some point in my life. Picture monk filled temples over-looking
crystal clear mountain streams in the mountains and you get an idea of
how awesome and peaceful a place it is.</p>
