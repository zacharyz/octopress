<p>I was actually confused this morning when I looked at my scale. I was
expecting to see 161 or 162 and hadn't expected to lose that last pound for
another few days. Coming back from my last trip where I was consistently
hovering just barely over 170 - loseit kept predicting my completion date as
getting ever closer to the end of the year. This made me think more and more
than it was unreasonable to lose 30 pounds in the time frame I wanted.</p>

<p>This past week I have had only one thing in mind with regards to my diet - eat
whatever I wanted to as long as I was under budget.
Loseit lists ice-cream as one of my favorite foods. This shows me that a large part of losing
weight is really about managing <em>how much</em> you eat.</p>

<p>For the first few months I ran and exercised like a mad man, which made me
feel great. Then when I was injured I didn't have the luxury of knowing that I
would be able to eat those 400-600 more calories thanks to my run. Loading up
on calories can be incredibly easy - a bag of chips, some ice-cream, eating
out. Bam - you just consumed more calories than your body can burn. So the
important thing for me was learning to manage my portions and how much I ate.</p>

<p>Now comes another challenge - not putting it all back on again.</p>

<p>My ankle is beginning to feel good enough to run on again and I am starting to
do more body weight exercises. I no doubt lost <em>some</em> muscle over the last
year and half where I didn't lift consistently so a part of me wants to try
and put that back on.</p>

<p>For now though I am thrilled to be going into the New Year knowing that I was
able to actually accomplish a weight loss goal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5029052528/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5029052528_6497518cc8.jpg" alt="10 lbs down from 190" /></a></p>

<p>In just over 3 weeks I have made it 1/3rd a way through my goal of losing 30
pounds and weighing 160. I woke up this morning after refueling with my cheat
day to weigh 180.</p>

<p>It hasn't been easy - but it has been fun. During this past month I have
logged more miles running than ever before. According to Nike+ I have logged
about 20 miles in the past week alone and lowered my 5k time below 30 minutes.
Not bad for someone who only recently completed the Couch to 5k program about
10 days ago.</p>

<p>For the next 10 pounds I plan to incorporate more weight training with kettle
bells as well as some jiu jitsu training. This past month has been all cardio
and I fear that I might plateau if I don't mix it up.</p>
