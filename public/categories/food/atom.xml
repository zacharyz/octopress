<p>I am spending a month working in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The weather here isn't exactly pleasant. The strange combination of cold,
wind, rain and snow means I am not spending much time outdoors. On my walks to
and from work I am bundled up and am amazed to see people going for jogs or
riding their bikes without their face or heads covered while it is raining and
freezing.</p>

<p>My time here has actually been healthier than usual despite being in a foreign
country. I chalk this up to two factors: 1) My apartment/hotel has a clean
pool and decent weight room 2) the food here is pretty lackluster. Combine
those traits with the craptastic weather and I have yet to really leave my
apartment except to go to work.</p>

<p>I feel zero desire to eat out because everything is bland and over priced and
I am working out and swimming every day. Food wise I have been following a
slow-carb diet which does away with carbs like sugars, pastas and breads. So
it is mostly vegetables and proteins. My most common meal has been eggs, beans
and some frozen vegetables. Yummy.</p>

<p>At the office we get catered lunches. Everyone always complains about the
quality but it is a perk that I definitely appreciate and don't get to take
advantage of because I work remotely. There is just enough variety that I
don't have to deviate from my diet.</p>

<p>I plan to spend my first weekend here decompressing from a busy but productive
week of work by mostly reading on my kindle. The weather is going to be decent
- at least rain and snow isn't on the forecast. I hope to be able to get out
and grab some more pictures or chill in a cafe some place.</p>

<p>The upcoming weekends should be more interesting though. So far I have booked
weekend trips to London and Paris. It will be my first time traveling to
either place. Both flights have me leaving Friday after work and returning
Sunday night. Once you are in Europe it is pretty remarkable where you can
travel to for 100-200 bucks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday as I was returning home from work I saw a familiar face locking up a
bike outside my apartment. It turned out to be a friend of Seyoung's who lives
here in Copenhagen - <a href="http://chyix2.blogspot.com/">Chyi Chyi</a>!.</p>

<p>After meeting with Seyoung for the first time in person, Chyi then proceeded
to treat us both to dinner and a long tour of East Copenhagen otherwise known
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederiksstaden">Frederiksstaden</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776793208/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4776793208_09752bf39d_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The tour began with a walk through some yellow housing known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyboder">Nyboder</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776794380/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4776794380_21a17328a3_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>My first view of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik's_Church">Marble Church</a>:</p>

<p>For dinner we were treated to traditional Danish food at Restaurant Vita which
was in a building over 300 years old. I had the fried pork with parsley sauce.</p>

<p>After dinner Chyi took us through downtown to the opera house:

<p>We then walked past a canal where tons of people were enjoying a Jazz
festival.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776155343/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4776155343_d22fde2193_b.jpg"></a>

<p>As the sun began to set we approached the Royal Danish PlayHouse:

<p>The tour then headed towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalienborg_Palace">AmalienborgPalace"</a> where the Danish
royal family lives. Before that we past by some gardens and a fountain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776152757/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4776152757_9bc79a122e_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>After the fountain we got our first glimpse of the palace square:

<p>After the palace we made our way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Alban's_Church,_Copenhagen">St Alban's Church</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776783040/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4776783040_11f9dfd5ff_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Next to it was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefion_Fountain">Gefion Fountain</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776781604/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4776781604_34dde7b79d_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Eventually we got to the spotwhere there is usually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(statue">statue</a> of the
Little Mermaid that was made famous by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>.
The statue is currently on display in China, so instead we were <em>treated</em> to a big screen in the water.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776779794/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4776779794_26b1255b54_b.jpg" title="yo dawg why you gotta be in my picture" ></a></p>

<p>The tour ended with a walk through the The Genetically Modified Paradise which included variations of the little mermaid statue.</p>

<p>Copenhagen is a compact and beautiful city and it was a pleasure to have such
a fantastic tour of this part of it. Thanks again Chyi! For more of the
pictures I have taken during my stay in Copenhagen - feel free to visit my
