<p>This is was taken just north of the area where I learned to surf while on
the island.</p>

<p>After briefly attempting to surf 5 years ago I wanted to make sure I learned how to
do it right and ended up finding <a
href="http://buttonssurfschool.com/">Buttons</a>. He turned out to be a local legend and former touring pro. He
had me up and surfing on the very first wave and probably inspired a
life long love of the sport.</p>

<p>Out of the few sunsets that I have taken here on Oahu my one regret so far was that I
had not grabbed a truely pink one yet. The weather conditions have been
a little too nice here which has lead to a relatively clear sky, which
in photography terms is boring.</p>

<p>We spent the day touring the South East side of the island like tourists
without the intention of grabbing a sunset. This included a trip to
Moana Falls and Waikiki. Just before deciding to head home for the day I caught
a glimpse of the beach and decided to check it out. I hadn't expected
much but after a few minutes the light changed drastically and the sky
turned pink.</p>

<p>Portlock Beach is surrounded by million dollar homes. Thankfully the
beaches are still public property and there are public access to all of
them. When I was taking this picture there was a small group of locals
taking advantage of the public access to fish and enjoy the sunset as
well. I couldn't help but appreciate how very fortunate they are to be able to enjoy a million dollar
view and fish every day.</p>

<p>This is a 102 second exposure done using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012LO1UG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ftp0e-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B0012LO1UG&adid=0SRAV7KBSA7DQ2K3VZ49&">Neutral Density 1000x filter</a>. The filter
acts to block out the light requiring the picture to take 10 times as
long to properly expose. During that amount of time the water and light
change and over time evens out leaving the glassy look that you see.</p>
