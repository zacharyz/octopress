<p>I spend every day at work making web apps so when it came down to making
a site for my upcoming wedding I wanted something simple. I decided to forego using any frameworks
or even using a database and instead make a single page - static site. Check it
out at <a href="http://zacharyandseyoung.com">zacharyandseyoung.com</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of the design was convey all the information that our guests
would need - date, place, directions etc. Additionally though I wanted to make
sure that once guests traveled here they would have a great list of
things to do that didn't involve the wedding and which would hopefully
give them an appreciation for the city that we love and call home.</p>

<p>I also wanted something that would look good on either a PC, tablet or
phone.</p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The site itself is just html/css/js using bootstrap for its basic grid system
and mobile friendly responsiveness with some custom styling.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses some additional js that wasn't included in stock bootstrap like fitvid.js for video
resizing and sticky.js for the navigation but over all I was able to accomplish what I wanted
much faster than without it.</p></li>
<li><p>The RSVP form is just a simple wufoo form that emails us when someone
registers.</p></li>
</ul>
