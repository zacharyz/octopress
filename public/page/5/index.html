<p>I was in Montreal for the past week to attend <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite 2010</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first time that I have traveled to Canada, so add one more country
to the <em>list</em> of new countries I have visited this year.</p>

<p>Montreal felt very European to me with its architecture and cobble stone
streets. This contrasted greatly with the people who lived there. At one
moment I could be sitting next to a group of people speaking perfect English
as they discussed video games, then in the next I would be surrounded by
people who only spoke French.</p>

<div class='image' id='5167757288'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5167757288/><img class='center' src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5167757288_c1c00694a8_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Old Town Montreal Panorama</span></h2></div>


<p>I am not used to being so well treated on a company trip. I am used to sharing
cheap motels with co-workers as we tested how many we can pile in a single
room. For this trip each of us were setup in 4 star hotels in the middle of
Old Town Montreal, just a block away from the [Notre-Dame Basilica of</p>

<p>Overall Montreal was a beautiful city with nice people and great food I just
wish I didn&#8217;t get sick mid-trip and was able to appreciate it more.</p>

<p>The Gorge is absolutely stunning right now. The water levels are high and the
trees are filled with oranges and yellows. If you can find a dry enough day as
I was lucky enough to this weekend then you need to do yourself a favor and
make your way out there before all the color disappears.</p>

<div class='image' id='5137536926'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5137536926/><img class='center' src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5137536926_0691dc3087_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Multnomah Falls at Fall</span></h2></div>


<p>This was my first hike in my Vibram Five Finger Trek shoes and it was a
breeze. They handled the rocky uphill climb with ease and were still
comfortable after I waded into the cold water to get the shots that I wanted.</p>

<p>It was good to see a healthy amount of photographers out with tripods (I
counted about ten). I don&#8217;t think people realize how much better their
waterfall shots will be if they use one as it is nearly impossible to get a
sharp shot that has that silky water effect that can only be achieved by
having a shot that is exposed for 1-2 seconds. One guy had a $3000 camera and
was convinced he didn&#8217;t need to use my tripod when I offered it because he
felt that his expensive camera would be enough.</p>

<p>Towards the end of our stay in Zurich Switzerland we decided that we wanted to
find a good view of the city. The local city information guide recommended
that be board a tram and take it up to the zoo.</p>

<p>It was already late in the day and the zoo was closed, so when we arrived
there was no one else around. For a moment I was worried that we would be
stranded. Around where we were there was no obvious view.</p>

<p>Eventually I struck up the courage to try and ask a local if he had any idea
where we might find the view that the guide had referred to. He didn&#8217;t speak a
bit of English but after a few silly gestures from myself - a huge smile
formed on a his face and he knew exactly what we were looking for.</p>

<div class='image' id='4866237215'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4866237215/><img class='center' src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4866237215_777ed3e365_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Zurich</span></h2></div>


<p>A short walk past a simply amazing field of sunflowers revealed a spectacular
view of the city. From there we could see the Alps in the distance as well as
the beautiful city in its entirety.</p>

<p>Zurich is a very expensive city to do anything in, but for the price of a tram
pass we were treated to a very special view that I feel few tourists are
treated to.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful city.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4079/4997164722_061f7d95a8_b.jpg" title="Vibram Fivefingers KSO Trek" ></p>

<p>When I was in high-school I used to run on the cross-country team. It was a
way for me to train in the off seasons between baseball and wrestling.
Eventually I actually became decent recording my fastest 5k time at around 19
minutes, which translates to about a 6 minute mile pace.</p>

<p>It was never easy and I never enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I remember starting every race without imagining what it would be like to
finish it. I simply put one foot in front of the other and kept pace with a
buddy until I could see the finish line - then I would sprint across it like a
mad man and puke my guts out.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3291/3015371980_6874e1ab49.jpg" title="Cross Country with Michael" ></p>

<p>I kept it up a little bit in college but over the years simply gave up on it. I think
around 5 years ago I was still able to run at an 8 minute mile pace.
Eventually though my knee began to hurt when I ran. Without a doubt my pains
are a result of years of playing tennis aggressively. There was a point when I
was playing almost daily that I couldn&#8217;t imagine there being a ball that I
wouldn&#8217;t try to track down and return. One day though something clicked and
since then there wasn&#8217;t a hitting session or run that wouldn&#8217;t end with my
knee swelling up and me being barely able to walk for a day.</p>

<p>I asked a doctor what could be done. He looked at my knee and determined that
there wasn&#8217;t anything toren but there was a build up of cartilage that would
require surgery to remove. His advice: give up tennis - it simply wasn&#8217;t worth
going through surgery when my knee was only aggravated when I played tennis.</p>

<p>As you could imagine this didn&#8217;t sit well with me - after all tennis is
something that I love. It did force me to evaluate what exactly it was about
tennis that caused my knee to hurt. My conclusion was that it was caused by
the constant pounding, starting and stopping that occurs during tennis - all
of which is felt by my knee. Tennis shoes have an immense amount of padding on
the heel which only encourages you to drive your foot harder into the ground.</p>

<p>The more my knee hurt that more I hated myself for not running over the years.
I missed the days when I used to be able to fly across a field faster than the
wind. Now the very thought of it would cause my knee to ache.</p>

<p>My running stride in the past has always been very long. Where each stride I
would drive my heel into the ground and bound off of it like a deer. I used to
want to replicate the covers of running magazines that I saw when I was a kid.
Running shoes by their very nature encourage this type of stride despite how
un-natural it is. Try it for yourself - take off your shoes and go run across
a field. You will find that you will naturally land on the balls of your feet.</p>

<p>The human foot is the result of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution
and yet a couple of decades of marketing by shoe manufacturers have convinced
people that it is flawed and that they should be <em>corrected</em>. It was this line
of reasoning and the book Born to Run that lead me to buying the craziest
looking shoes that I had ever seen - Vibram Five Fingers.</p>

<p>I had put off buying a pair for well over a year. First because they aren&#8217;t
exactly good looking, and second because I had a perfectly good pair of
running shoes. The selection of these expensive running shoes were the result
of going to a running store and having my stride recorded and analyzed so that
I would have the perfect running shoe for my feet. Compared to any other shoe
that I had ever had - running in these felt great. The only problem though is
that whenever I ran fast, I would go into my comfortable stride that involved
driving my heels into the ground which would lead to my knee hurting and me
regretting my decision to run.</p>

<p>The basic point of Vibram Five Finger shoes is to replicate what it is like to
be barefooted while still having the excellent traction and durability of a
Vibram sole. I went with the KSO (keep stuff out) trek model. Vibram makes a
model that is geared specifically towards road running, but I wanted something
that I could take on trails while still looking some what inconspicuous. The
average VFF has wild colors that I think most VFF enthusiasts appreciate
because they love the attention that they bring. I just wanted to be able to
run pain free.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5029224752_a4d697649d.jpg"></p>

<p>It has been about 10 days since I got my pair of VFF. During that time I have
logged 21 miles and ran more consistently than I have ever before - or been
able to in the past. It feels awesome to wake up and actually want to be able
to run again instead of dreading the pain that would follow.</p>

<p>My stride has changed drastically. I have been trying for the past year to run
on the balls of my feet, but VFF make it so much easier. Instead of long
strides I now take short, quick steps that land below my center of gravity
rather than in front of it.</p>

<p>The result of this new way of running is that my stride is way more economical
than it used to be and my dropping 5k time is proof of it. I now feel like I
can run longer and faster than before. Best of all my knee doesn&#8217;t hurt at all
after a run or even a weeks worth of runs. I have gone from running on average
15 miles a month at the beginning of the year - all which ended in pain - to
over 50 this month alone.</p>

<p>I have years to make up before I will be able to run at the speed that I ran
in high-school but thanks to Vibram Five Fingers I feel like it is possible
that I will be able to. As an added bonus in the last month I have lost 10
pounds as a result of running again. I still have about 20 pounds more to go
until I reach one of my goals of the year of getting down to 160 but thanks to
my new found love of running I am feeling lighter and healthier than I have
all year.</p>

<p>Brussels was actually the last stop on our trip. We managed to find some
relatively cheap tickets out of Brussels back to Portland so decided to spend
a day here. By the time we got to Brussels though we were exhausted and ended
up sleeping all day in our hostel so we didn&#8217;t get to explore much. We were
fortunate enough though to be about a block away from one of the city&#8217;s main
attractions - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Place">The Grand Place</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4892575306/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4892575306_1e4666a937_b.jpg" title="The Maison du Roi" ></a></p>

<p>The Grand Place - or Grote Markt is a square in the middle of the city. The
main attractions are the Town Hall and The Maison du Roi (King&#8217;s House). These
buildings are considered to be some of the most beautiful in Europe.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the above picture are a group of Americans embarrassing
themselves after one of them drank way more than she could handle. Shortly
after this was taken she sprung up, sprinted across the square, then tripped
and fell on her face. Police eventually looked in on them and advised that she
get up because the bricks get cold at night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4892571604/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4892571604_0b4f7969a5_b.jpg" alt="The Grand Place" /></a></p>

<p>At night the city puts on a little show at the Town Hall with lights and
music. The sound of this event was enough to drag me out of bed and encourage
me to take some pictures.</p>

<p>Our hostel was actually some where on this street. It didn&#8217;t even have a sign. One of the
things I am going to miss about Belgium in particular was enjoying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer">trappist beer</a>.
For about one euro you can get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochefort_Brewery">11.3% ABV Rochefort 10</a>.There was just somethingabout drinking a beer that had first been brewed over 400 years ago.</p>

<p>I unfortunately did not get to explore much of Denmark outside of Copenhagen. I was able to visit
a small harbor town located 12 km outside of Copenhagen named
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag%C3%B8r">Dragor</a>, which despite its simple
spelling - is quite hard to pronounce. The most remarkable thing about this
town was its many well perserved picturesque historical buildings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4820689020/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4820689020_85f02b2a4f_b.jpg" title="Dragor Harbor" ></a></p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t a lot to say about the town itself, other than it is small and very cute. The buildings are all very
historic Danish with yellow paint, cobblestone streets and the occasional
thatched roof.</p>

<p>The town was quite touristy and had two bars near the harbor which each
exclusively served one of the two main competing beers in Copenhagen. We dined
at the one that served Carlsberg.</p>

<p>Still the town clearly had a lively amount of fisherman, which thanks to their
tans, were easily to tell apart from the tourists.</p>

<p>On one our final nights in Copenhagen we decided to finally give in and try out one of the canal tours.
At this point there wasn&#8217;t any part of the tour that we hadn&#8217;t already seen,
so this gave me an advantage in terms of what to expect. It also meant I could
really relax and enjoy the tour.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4821610209/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4821610209_ee4d3d8450_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The tour began just as the sun began to set, so we had some great lighting, but for the first time since
we arrived we also got to experience cool weather here.</p>

<p>An old sub-yard turned into an upscale apartment complex.</p>

<p>A view of the Marble Church and the Palace fountain.</p>

<p>According to the guide this is the most photographed tree in Copenhagen
as everyone takes a picture of it while trying to get a shot of the church as
it comes into view.</p>

<p>Over all the tour was a fantastic way to experience Copenhagen. I hope you enjoyed the pictures, please feel free to

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenborg_Castle">Castle Rosenborg</a> is located in the
center of Copenhagen. It is surrounded by a nice park, called The King&#8217;s
Garden, that people go to during the day for picnics and to relax.</p>

<p>As far as castles go, it is actually quite small and the real highlight is
that the crown jewels reside here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4808766088/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4808766088_83175219e3_b.jpg"></a>

<p>Chi took us on a tour of this castle to give
us a taste of Danish history. I purchased an additional pass that let me take
pictures inside.</p>

<p>The castle is filled with tapestries, intricate clocks, detailed ceilings,
busts of royalty and paintings galore.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4808763158/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4808763158_0ae4aa6537_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>This was actually the King&#8217;s toilet and was located quite a bit aways from the throne room.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4808127571/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4808127571_8d726d4d58_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>One of the highlights was when a guy who looked like Peter Griffen got all
huffy when I accidentally fell on a chair while trying to frame a shot around
him.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4808736746/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4808736746_77a5d86ac6_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The guy in this tapestry seemed to contrast with the rest of the imagery.</p>

<p>After throne room we headed down to the real <em>gem</em> of the tour - the royal
treasure vault.</p>
