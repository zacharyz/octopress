  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday as I was returning home from work I saw a familiar face locking up a
bike outside my apartment. It turned out to be a friend of Seyoung&#8217;s who lives
here in Copenhagen - <a href="http://chyix2.blogspot.com/">Chyi Chyi</a>!.</p>

<p>After meeting with Seyoung for the first time in person, Chyi then proceeded
to treat us both to dinner and a long tour of East Copenhagen otherwise known
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederiksstaden">Frederiksstaden</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776793208/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4776793208_09752bf39d_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The tour began with a walk through some yellow housing known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyboder">Nyboder</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776794380/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4776794380_21a17328a3_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776794020/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4776794020_c0d2decd37_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>My first view of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik's_Church">Marble Church</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776791716/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4074/4776791716_609e9ddda9_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>For dinner we were treated to traditional Danish food at Restaurant Vita which
was in a building over 300 years old. I had the fried pork with parsley sauce.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776790980/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4776790980_fc88d9eb22_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>After dinner Chyi took us through downtown to the opera house:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776789682/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4776789682_d101eab2b3_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>We then walked past a canal where tons of people were enjoying a Jazz
festival.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776155343/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4776155343_d22fde2193_b.jpg"></a>

<p>As the sun began to set we approached the Royal Danish PlayHouse:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776787742/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4776787742_a1c28c3b4d_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The tour then headed towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalienborg_Palace">AmalienborgPalace&#8221;</a> where the Danish
royal family lives. Before that we past by some gardens and a fountain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776152757/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4776152757_9bc79a122e_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>After the fountain we got our first glimpse of the palace square:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776785848/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4776785848_4228d7a998_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>After the palace we made our way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Alban's_Church,_Copenhagen">St Alban&#8217;s Church</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776783040/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4776783040_11f9dfd5ff_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Next to it was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefion_Fountain">Gefion Fountain</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776781604/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4776781604_34dde7b79d_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Eventually we got to the spotwhere there is usually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(statue">statue</a> of the
Little Mermaid that was made famous by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>.
The statue is currently on display in China, so instead we were <em>treated</em> to a big screen in the water.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776779794/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4776779794_26b1255b54_b.jpg" title="yo dawg why you gotta be in my picture" ></a></p>

<p>The tour ended with a walk through the The Genetically Modified Paradise which included variations of the little mermaid statue.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4776779266/"><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4776779266_d8c79d4812_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Copenhagen is a compact and beautiful city and it was a pleasure to have such
a fantastic tour of this part of it. Thanks again Chyi! For more of the
pictures I have taken during my stay in Copenhagen - feel free to visit my

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been just about a day since I completed my first international flight
and arrived in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>My flight took me from Portland -> Seattle -> Reykjavik -> Copenhagen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773905873/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4773905873_9b8d0e6813_z%0A.jpg" alt="Got my tickets" /></a></p>

<p>I have always wanted to go to Iceland, unfortunately for this trip I could
only stay there for an hour. With customs, my stay there felt even shorter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774536948/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4774536948_5542de6%0A4a4_z.jpg" alt="Flying Over Iceland" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773905185/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4773905185_5e75dbab71_%0Az.jpg" alt="Iceland Airport" /></a></p>

<p>Landing in Denmark provided a much better view.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774535678/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4774535678_c79208a%0A801_z.jpg" alt="Approaching Denmark" /></a></p>

<p>Navigating through the Copenhagen airport was a painless experience. They
didn&#8217;t even bother to check our passports upon arriving. This is truly the
land of freakishly tall vikings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774543168/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4774543168_c849%0Aaa3ab6_z.jpg" alt="Arriving in Copenhagen" /></a></p>

<p>From the airport we rode a train to get to our apartment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773902847/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4773902847_84242%0A19d03_z.jpg" alt="Waiting for the Train" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773901479/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4773901479_d3ccd16%0Aaa5_z.jpg" alt="Riding on the Train" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774539740/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4774539740_95b7918495_z.jpg" alt="The Train" />
</a></p>

<p>My initial impression of Copenhagen is just how clean and impressive the city
is. The streets were filled with people on bicycles - way more than were ever
in Portland.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773900005/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4773900005_b1911%0Aa27e8_z.jpg" alt="Going to my Apartment" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773898945/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4773898945_2d1d9454%0A98_z.jpg" alt="View of the Tracks" /></a></p>

<p>If there was ever any need for further proof of what a simple creature I am
then just look at the beer that my girlfriend picked out for me without
asking. Despite not being able to read a word, she was able to pick out what
is now my favorite beer. Apparently juice + beer is delicious.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774535018/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4774535018_97ea6f205%0A4_z.jpg" alt="New Favorite Beer" /></a></p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t fall asleep until well past midnight local time which is about a 9
hour time difference from Portland. It didn&#8217;t get dark till around 10:30. At
4:30 in the morning I was woken up by light pouring into our windows.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773895789/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4773895789_a2eeda%0A175b_z.jpg" alt="Outside my Apartment" /></a></p>

<p>I am now exhausted after spending the day in the office and surviving off of
around 5 cups of coffee.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two of my goals for this year are to finally get a passport and to work abroad
for 2 months. I wasn&#8217;t one of those fortunate kids who got to tour Europe out
of college or high school. After graduating I immediately began working and
aside from a trip back to Hawaii a few years ago I haven&#8217;t had the opportunity
to leave the main land - let alone go to another country.</p>

<h2>New Job</h2>

<p>In May I was hired on by a very hot company called Unity Technologies as a web
developer. I had been contracting with them for about a month prior to being
hired. They also flew me down to San Francisco in April to be their official
photographer and to document their time at the Game Developers Conference.
Unity has long been a competitor in the middleware game engine space with a
company I used to work for - GarageGames. While GG shifted their focus over
the last few years to other <a href="http://instantaction.com">things</a>, Unity focused
on improving their core products and have steadily gotten better, and more
profitable over the years.</p>

<p>One of my requirements for working with them was that I have the freedom to
continue living in Portland, rather than move to San Francisco where their
North American office is based. We agreed that I would occasionally (about
once a month) work at the office, but the rest of the time I would be free to
work anywhere else. It has worked out for the most part except that their
<em>primary</em> office (and where the rest of the developers work) are actually in
Copenhagen, which is about a 9 hour time difference to Portland.</p>

<h2>Going to Copenhagen</h2>

<p>My project(s) are for the most part independent of what the rest of the
developers at Unity are working on. I focus primarily on web related projects
(store, site, etc), while the rest of the Unity is focusing on engine and tool
development. Still our paths do occasionally cross so it makes perfect sense
for me to become better acquainted with them. The solution then is to fly my
girlfriend and I over for at least a month, set us up in a hotel, and force us
to enjoy Copenhagen during the summer.</p>

<p>A co-worker has a vacation coming up at the end of July so they wanted to make
getting me out there a top priority so that we would have plenty of time to
work together. This gave me just the excuse I needed to get my passport, and
also gets me half way through another goal of working abroad for 2 months.</p>

<p>On July 6th I will be taking my first international flight to Copenhagen where
I will be working on-site for at least 3-4 weeks.</p>

<h2>Passport Acquired</h2>

<p>I had always entertained the idea of getting a passport whenever I went to the
post office. When I finally did go that purpose though the place was packed
with people had the same idea. Thankfully I was 2nd in the line, because it
took the guy almost an hour to process me alone. We got the fastest processing
time possible and my passport arrived in just under 2 weeks.</p>

<h2>Beyond Copenhagen</h2>

<p>I ended up getting us one way tickets to avoid having to commit to a departure
city and to keep our travels open ended. There is just way to much of Europe
that I would like to explore but I have neither the time or the money to do it
right now. We would like to see some of the near by countries like Germany,
Belgium, and the Netherlands. I also wouldn&#8217;t mind being able to stay in a
single awesome city for a week and just explore the heck out of it. Either way
we have the month in Copenhagen to figure it out.</p>

<h2>Plans for this Site</h2>

<p>My plans are to be more active on this site in terms of documenting my
experiences with traveling - beyond my photography, though I promise there
will be plenty more of that. In preparation for my trip I finally graduated
from my flimsy $35 aluminum tripod that I got years ago to a nice, light,
travel-friendly carbon fiber Manfrotto tripod.</p>

<p>Expect lots of panoramas and HDR like shots in the future as we tour around
Copenhagen and beyond.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t very often that I get shots of myself, thankfully my girlfriend was
willing to help me out. Her parents are visiting from Korea and love to hike
as much as I do so we decided to give Dog Mountain a chance despite the
promise of wet weather.</p>

<p>Dog Mountain is 3.8 mile trip to the top, and it is all up hill. When we got
to the top it was enveloped in a cloud so there wasn&#8217;t much to look at.
Eventually there was a break in the clouds which revealed a spectacular view
of the gorge covered in wild flowers.</p>

The water level is so high this time of year that you can&#8217;t view these falls from the lower level without getting really wet and I didn&#8217;t want to risk my gear. This is unfortunate because the falls looked amazing. The last time I had a chance to get out here it was right before winter, so the water level was much lower.

Eagle Creek in general is fantastic right now and is a Waterfall Wonderland with tons of beautiful tiny waterfalls pouring out along the trail.</em></p></div>

<p>I have owned a pair of snow shoes for about 2 years now. REI had a sweet deal on a pair for $30 with free
shipping so, along with some friends, I bought a pair. It wasn&#8217;t until the day
after Christmas that I would actually get a chance to use them.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4235209582_0785705175_b.jpg"></p>

<p>Some lessons I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mittens may be less agile than regular gloves, but they keep your hands much warmer.</li>
<li>When hiking at 5000 feet the altitude can be killer. Every extra pound of weight makes a difference.</li>
<li>Pack light and dress warm.</li>
<li>Walking in snow shoes takes getting used to. At first they are constantly in the way but after a while you will be gliding around.</li>
<li>Even a cheap, several year old GPS system can be pretty darn awesome when every direction looks the same.</li>
</ul>
