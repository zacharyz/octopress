      <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801412964/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5316/5801412964_e30f23d3ce_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Whenever I cross the Morrison bridge on a clear day in Portland one particular
object seems to stand out on the horizon - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood">Mount Hood</a>.
Hood is the highest mountain in Oregon at 11,249 ft yet around 10,000 people a year climb it. Now every
time that I see it I can say I am one of them.</p>

<p>This past Thursday a good friend of mine invited me to climb it and I quickly
agreed to it. The exact conversation went like this:</p>

<p><strong>Craig</strong>: want to climb a mountain?</p>

<p><strong>me</strong>: yes</p>

<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Hood?</p>

<p><strong>me</strong>: yep</p>

<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Have time Friday night/Saturday morning?</p>

<p><strong>me</strong>: yep</p>

<p>The next day I made my way to the local REI to rent and purchase some gear (an
Ice Axe, Helmet and Head Lamp) and that night found myself in the Timberline
parking lot freezing my ass off. Joining us on the hike were two others - Jon
and Tom. Everyone but myself had climbed Hood at least once before, with Tom
having climbed it three times previously.</p>

<p>The first words Tom spoke after parking the car and feeling the wind and
coldness - &#8220;OK let&#8217;s go back now.&#8221; Maybe it was the excitement or maybe it was
because of the month I had spent working in Copenhagen during the winter, but
the cold wasn&#8217;t affecting me at all. I actually stripped down to my underwear
and changed in the middle of the parking lot while everyone else huddled in
the car.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5800822641/"><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2087/5800822641_29c6542bff_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>We started the climb at 1:40am. Climbers try to Summit before the sun fully
rises as the final part of the hike can get dangerous when the snow begins to
melt and freeze. So by doing it early you attempt to avoid that danger.</p>

<p>The day before the hike I mentally prepared myself for it. A few years ago I
climbed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/sets/72157606145105082/">South Sisters</a>
so I had some experience with climbing. Namely that no matter what shape that I was
in physically there would come a time where I would be looking at my feet
focusing on each individual step and would have to will myself to continue on.
This happened quite often during the hike.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5800830697/"><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3267/5800830697_87ba4236a4_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801391942/"><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3461/5801391942_4fddd0eee0_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Despite the strong winds we managed to completely avoid losing any gear. At
least 3 times we had a piece of equipment fly off down the mountain only to be
chased down and retrieved by Craig.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801399002/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5067/5801399002_92de94a5fd_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801404006/"><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2342/5801404006_9d116ab4d3_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of the hike was when the sun was still rising on the
other side of the mountain. This would cause the snow to melt and blow over
the peak. The sun would catch on the snow and light it up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801407450/"><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3556/5801407450_d0e713bf9b_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5800856449/"><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2653/5800856449_58e15b51d4_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>We kept a pretty slow pace. The softness of the snow ment that if your footing
wasn&#8217;t sure then you would be sliding back down. Repeating that over thousands
of steps is very exhausting. So we weren&#8217;t surprised to see lots of teams pass
us on the way up and then back down again.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the hike was dealing with the strong and cold winds. Often
I would have to stop and kneel during the hike until the wind died down.</p>

<p>When we got past Crater Rock and on to the the Hogsback we learned that many teams were turning back and not
completing the summit due to the weather conditions. By the time we were there
though the weather had cleared up enough that it wasn&#8217;t completely insane to
make the final traversal from the Pearly Gates to the Summit.</p>

<p>The climb up to the Pearly Gates was one of the more difficult parts of the
hike. To accomplish this climb we needed to equip our grampons, helmets and
use our ice axes. Equipping my grampons was particularly challenging due to
the extreme snow flurries that would blow past us on the Hogsback. More than
once I had to pause and heat my hands back from numbness.</p>

<p>Using the ice axe and grampons was a whole new challenge for myself. It was a
slow process of planting the axe handle into the ice and using it belay
yourself while you kick your feet into solid footing. The entire time there is
the risk that you will slip and slide down uncontrollably into a crevice at
the bottom.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801414860/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5319/5801414860_9274fe7933_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>8 Hours later though and we were at the top.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801421406/"><img class="center" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2242/5801421406_1a6464af25_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5800869465/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5800869465_32a2f800c0_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5800875441/"><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3198/5800875441_4a5b758fbf_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5800862369/"><img class="center" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3578/5800862369_07d54cf9d7_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The trip back down was actually the hardest part of the hike. Coming up we
couldn&#8217;t actually see how far we had to go or how high we had to climb because
of the darkness. Going down was just the opposite and the parking lot never
seemed to ever get closer while my body began to hurt more and more.</p>

<p>After all of it though I can now look on Hood and say to myself that I had
conquered it. Which is a pretty good feeling. It was a hard hike but I
honestly enjoyed every bit of it.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t noticed - <a href="http://zaczadell.com/tag/panoramas/">I love panoramas.</a> I think they do a fantastic
job of capturing the feel of a location much better than any single picture
could and they aren&#8217;t all that difficult to produce. Here is a quick tutorial
on the methods that I use to take awesome travel panoramas.</p>

<p>I generally rely on two primary methods for taking them - either with my big
dslr and photoshop or my iphone and a stitching app.</p>

<h3>DSLR, Photoshop and Optionally a Tripod</h3>

<p>This is the more established method that I use when I want something that I
intend to either print out or blow up later. The method requires that I take
several pictures that slightly overlap with a wide angle lens. If I can I will
use my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015MFTE4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ftp0e-%0A20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0015MFTE4">tripod</a> that has a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UOCWUK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ftp0e-2%0A0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002UOCWUK">panning head</a> on it, which
allows me to take sharp shots with precise overlap.</p>

<p>When a tripod isn&#8217;t available though I simply snap a bunch of pictures and
manually pan from left to right (or vica verca) across the scene.</p>

<p>Once you get the hang of it, the process takes only slightly longer than
taking a single shot. I tend to take 3-5 shots for every panorama.</p>

<p>The next step is to use photoshop&#8217;s <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/P%0Ahotoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-75e8a.html">photomerge</a> feature. You
give it a list of pictures and it will try and blend them together in a
meaningful way - usually a panorama.</p>

<h3>Iphone + autostitch app</h3>

<p>I can&#8217;t always have my camera + tripod with me but I will most likely have my
phone. For the cost of a cheap app (under $3 and totally worth every penny), I
can grab panoramas wherever I go. I use
<a href="http://www.cloudburstresearch.com/autostitch/autostitch.html">autostitch</a>.</p>

<p>This method won&#8217;t yield the sharpest results but it will definitely be better
than nothing. The iphone&#8217;s lens isn&#8217;t very wide, so be sure to capture shots
both above and below the shots that make up your panorama. This will allow you
to take in some of the sky and ground. So instead of 3 shots you will end up
taking around 9. Autostich is a champ at combining everything together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5566228732/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5566228732_2d085237bb_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5565642185/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5225/5565642185_9bc61d33e7_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>You can also use the same method to take
vertical shots aka vertoramas. This picture of Saint Peters Cathedral is made
up of 3 images taken while panning vertically. Despite having a very wide
angle lens (10mm) there is no other way I could have captured the entire
building from that position without using this method.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and let me know if you want me to go into any greater
detail into what exactly is involved. Otherwise this should be enough to get
you started in taking awesome travel panoramas yourself.</p>

<p>The weather in Paris didn&#8217;t quite work out for me. I had planned on spending
the evening photographing the city at night only to find myself in a race to
stay dry while still getting <em>some</em> shots of the iconic tower. I had gone on a
3 hour tour the city after exploring the Louvre and was exhausted at this
point. I only had enough time to grab a few shots and ask some friendly
tourists to grab some shots of myself before the sky opened up and drenched
everyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5564797602/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5011/5564797602_801c2c9aee_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Oddly enough I met a ton of awesome Spanish people on this trip. I stayed in a
cheap hostel that had mixed dorms and ended up rooming with college-aged
Spanish girls. On the tour I ended up also meeting a bunch of guys from
Barcelona and Madrid. Their friendliness definitely convinced me to add Spain
to my future travels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5564790182/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5183/5564790182_4237505e55_b.jpg"></a></p>

<p>One of my goals for this trip was to travel as light as possible (while still
carrying my camera + lenses). I ended up not bringing my laptop or tripod and
wearing exclusively my vibram five fingers. The other tourists really got a
kick out of my vffs.</p>

<p>During one point in the trip I was sprinting between metros trying to make it
to my flight on time. A friendly French dude ended up leading me Parkour-style
over the ticket stalls and showing me how to avoid getting caught in the
process. Overall the French that I encountered left a really good impression
on me.</p>

<p>This picture represents a special memory for me. Not only was it an absolute
perfect night for photography but I also had a chance to take a picture of the
rare occurance of a <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/">super moon</a>.</p>

<p>This is one of the final pictures I took after a day of touring London. By
this point my entire body was complaining and I still had an hour long walk
ahead of me back to my hostel. Despite the pain I was incredibly happy to be
doing what I was where I was doing it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I leave on a cheap flight to spend the weekend in Paris - another
first for me. Thanks for viewing!</p>
