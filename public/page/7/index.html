  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been just about a day since I completed my first international flight
and arrived in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>My flight took me from Portland -> Seattle -> Reykjavik -> Copenhagen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773905873/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4773905873_9b8d0e6813_z%0A.jpg" alt="Got my tickets" /></a></p>

<p>I have always wanted to go to Iceland, unfortunately for this trip I could
only stay there for an hour. With customs, my stay there felt even shorter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774536948/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4774536948_5542de6%0A4a4_z.jpg" alt="Flying Over Iceland" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773905185/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4773905185_5e75dbab71_%0Az.jpg" alt="Iceland Airport" /></a></p>

<p>Landing in Denmark provided a much better view.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774535678/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4774535678_c79208a%0A801_z.jpg" alt="Approaching Denmark" /></a></p>

<p>Navigating through the Copenhagen airport was a painless experience. They
didn&#8217;t even bother to check our passports upon arriving. This is truly the
land of freakishly tall vikings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774543168/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4774543168_c849%0Aaa3ab6_z.jpg" alt="Arriving in Copenhagen" /></a></p>

<p>From the airport we rode a train to get to our apartment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773902847/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4773902847_84242%0A19d03_z.jpg" alt="Waiting for the Train" /></a></p>

</a></p>

<p>My initial impression of Copenhagen is just how clean and impressive the city
is. The streets were filled with people on bicycles - way more than were ever
in Portland.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773900005/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4773900005_b1911%0Aa27e8_z.jpg" alt="Going to my Apartment" /></a></p>

<p>If there was ever any need for further proof of what a simple creature I am
then just look at the beer that my girlfriend picked out for me without
asking. Despite not being able to read a word, she was able to pick out what
is now my favorite beer. Apparently juice + beer is delicious.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774535018/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4774535018_97ea6f205%0A4_z.jpg" alt="New Favorite Beer" /></a></p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t fall asleep until well past midnight local time which is about a 9
hour time difference from Portland. It didn&#8217;t get dark till around 10:30. At
4:30 in the morning I was woken up by light pouring into our windows.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773895789/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4773895789_a2eeda%0A175b_z.jpg" alt="Outside my Apartment" /></a></p>

<p>I am now exhausted after spending the day in the office and surviving off of
around 5 cups of coffee.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two of my goals for this year are to finally get a passport and to work abroad
for 2 months. I wasn&#8217;t one of those fortunate kids who got to tour Europe out
of college or high school. After graduating I immediately began working and
aside from a trip back to Hawaii a few years ago I haven&#8217;t had the opportunity
to leave the main land - let alone go to another country.</p>

<h2>New Job</h2>

<p>In May I was hired on by a very hot company called Unity Technologies as a web
developer. I had been contracting with them for about a month prior to being
hired. They also flew me down to San Francisco in April to be their official
photographer and to document their time at the Game Developers Conference.
Unity has long been a competitor in the middleware game engine space with a
company I used to work for - GarageGames. While GG shifted their focus over
the last few years to other <a href="http://instantaction.com">things</a>, Unity focused
on improving their core products and have steadily gotten better, and more
profitable over the years.</p>

<p>One of my requirements for working with them was that I have the freedom to
continue living in Portland, rather than move to San Francisco where their
North American office is based. We agreed that I would occasionally (about
once a month) work at the office, but the rest of the time I would be free to
work anywhere else. It has worked out for the most part except that their
<em>primary</em> office (and where the rest of the developers work) are actually in
Copenhagen, which is about a 9 hour time difference to Portland.</p>

<h2>Going to Copenhagen</h2>

<p>My project(s) are for the most part independent of what the rest of the
developers at Unity are working on. I focus primarily on web related projects
(store, site, etc), while the rest of the Unity is focusing on engine and tool
development. Still our paths do occasionally cross so it makes perfect sense
for me to become better acquainted with them. The solution then is to fly my
girlfriend and I over for at least a month, set us up in a hotel, and force us
to enjoy Copenhagen during the summer.</p>

<p>A co-worker has a vacation coming up at the end of July so they wanted to make
getting me out there a top priority so that we would have plenty of time to
work together. This gave me just the excuse I needed to get my passport, and
also gets me half way through another goal of working abroad for 2 months.</p>

<p>On July 6th I will be taking my first international flight to Copenhagen where
I will be working on-site for at least 3-4 weeks.</p>

<h2>Passport Acquired</h2>

<p>I had always entertained the idea of getting a passport whenever I went to the
post office. When I finally did go that purpose though the place was packed
with people had the same idea. Thankfully I was 2nd in the line, because it
took the guy almost an hour to process me alone. We got the fastest processing
time possible and my passport arrived in just under 2 weeks.</p>

<h2>Beyond Copenhagen</h2>

<p>I ended up getting us one way tickets to avoid having to commit to a departure
city and to keep our travels open ended. There is just way to much of Europe
that I would like to explore but I have neither the time or the money to do it
right now. We would like to see some of the near by countries like Germany,
Belgium, and the Netherlands. I also wouldn&#8217;t mind being able to stay in a
single awesome city for a week and just explore the heck out of it. Either way
we have the month in Copenhagen to figure it out.</p>

<h2>Plans for this Site</h2>

<p>My plans are to be more active on this site in terms of documenting my
experiences with traveling - beyond my photography, though I promise there
will be plenty more of that. In preparation for my trip I finally graduated
from my flimsy $35 aluminum tripod that I got years ago to a nice, light,
travel-friendly carbon fiber Manfrotto tripod.</p>

<p>Expect lots of panoramas and HDR like shots in the future as we tour around
Copenhagen and beyond.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t very often that I get shots of myself, thankfully my girlfriend was
willing to help me out. Her parents are visiting from Korea and love to hike
as much as I do so we decided to give Dog Mountain a chance despite the
promise of wet weather.</p>

<p>Dog Mountain is 3.8 mile trip to the top, and it is all up hill. When we got
to the top it was enveloped in a cloud so there wasn&#8217;t much to look at.
Eventually there was a break in the clouds which revealed a spectacular view
of the gorge covered in wild flowers.</p>

<p>Located about 2 miles into the Eagle Creek trail in the Columbia River Gorge.</p>

<p>The water level is so high this time of year that you can&#8217;t view these falls
from the lower level without getting really wet and I didn&#8217;t want to risk my
gear. This is unfortunate because the falls looked amazing. The last time I
had a chance to get out here it was right before winter, so the water level
was much lower.</p>

<p>Eagle Creek in general is fantastic right now and is a Waterfall Wonderland
with tons of beautiful tiny waterfalls pouring out along the trail.</p>

<p>I have owned a pair of snow shoes for about 2 years now. REI had a sweet deal on a pair for $30 with free
shipping so, along with some friends, I bought a pair. It wasn&#8217;t until the day
after Christmas that I would actually get a chance to use them.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4235209582_0785705175_b.jpg"></p>

<p>Some lessons I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mittens may be less agile than regular gloves, but they keep your hands much warmer.</li>
<li>When hiking at 5000 feet the altitude can be killer. Every extra pound of weight makes a difference.</li>
<li>Pack light and dress warm.</li>
<li>Walking in snow shoes takes getting used to. At first they are constantly in the way but after a while you will be gliding around.</li>
<li>Even a cheap, several year old GPS system can be pretty darn awesome when every direction looks the same.</li>
</ul>

<time datetime="2009-12-25T16:15:06-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 25<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The past year has been a tremendous year for personal growth (of not only my
gut) and I see 2010 as the year where I execute on what I have learned. I
believe one of the best ways of holding yourself accountable for your goals is
to put them in writing. So here are mine:</p>

<h2>1) Move to Portland.</h2>

<p>I moved to Eugene in January of 2005 to work for GarageGames. Right about the
time of what will be my 5 year anniversary of having moved here I will be
moving to Portland where my girlfriend and I will be sharing a house with
another couple until we can find and afford a place of our own. I don&#8217;t have a
job or any real prospects lined up and Portland has one of the highest rates
of unemployment in the nation, but compared to Eugene it has a heck of a lot
more going for it in just about every way that is important to us.</p>

<p>Coincidentally my girlfriend moved to Eugene during the same month as I did.
She completed her final term college this month and was able to finish her
Sociology degree. Remarkably, she was able to get a 4.0 (or better) in her
last 3 terms. By finishing up her degree we resolved the final reason for us
staying in Eugene. We both really adore Portland and so making the move there
is a huge step in the right direction for both of our futures.</p>

<h2>2) Continue to build out my Freelancing business</h2>

<p>One of my main reasons for moving to Portland is for the greater chance of
full-time employment, but at the same time I am not going to be waiting around
for companies to start hiring again.</p>

<p>The first half of the year really taught me what I value from myself and of my
professional life. It also taught me that I am pretty darn good at web
development and rekindled my love for it. My goal for the new year is to
continue getting freelance work and to <em>double my hourly rate</em>. I know
perfectly well that my current rate is actually well below what would be
considered standard for the quality of work that I do. But right now I am
concentrating on building up a portfolio of projects and work that I can use
to command the higher rate I deserve.</p>

<p>I registered an LLC in September and have since completed several projects
ranging from multiple Wordpress sites (including this one), Django powered
back-ends for iphone and heath care apps, and a Joomla site that required over
50 pages of content and a custom template and design. Every project has been
delivered on time and no doubt under budget.</p>

<p>All the projects that I have tackled so far have demonstrated expertise and
versatility in both front-and back-end web development, and my ability to
learn and adapt to changes quickly.</p>

<h2>3) Develop a passive income of at least $1000 a month</h2>

<p>The goal is to be able to generate enough income passively to be able to cover
my basic living expenses. The passive part is important. Passive income is
income that is generated by doing no additional work beyond the initial
investment. It happens regardless of whether you are sleeping or traveling.</p>

<p>The past year has shown me that I am capable of living fairly comfortably with
very little, all the while supporting my girlfriend through school and my mom
during this depression. Freelance work definitely has it highs and lows and
establishing a passive income enables me to take risks that I probably
wouldn&#8217;t be able to do otherwise because I&#8217;ll know that I have the freedom to
cover the necessities whether I am working or not.</p>

<p>I plan to do this with a combination of affiliate marketing sites as well as
ad revenue generated by some sides projects that I have in the works. This
goal will also help to facilitate goal #6.</p>

<h2>4) Lose 20 lbs.</h2>

<p>This goal is probably the closest I have to the typical new years resolution.
You would think that during a year where I have had the freedom to workout all
day/everyday I would be in tremendous shape. For the first half I actually was
because I basically worked-out and trained every day, but as I have focused
more on building my freelance career I have unfocused on other areas. I
haven&#8217;t touched a tennis racquet or seriously gone to the gym since October.
Starting January that is going to change quite drastically and more
importantly I will be holding myself accountable.</p>

<p>For me, 20 lbs should be easy. At the moment I weigh around 185 lbs. My lowest
since college was in 2006 where I got down to 155 lbs. 165 will be a happy
medium for me where I won&#8217;t be exceptionally lean but still be healthier
looking than I am presently.</p>

<p>I plan on achieving this weight loss the old fashion way - hard work and
dieting. I also plan to carefully document every workout that I do and every
food that I eat. By the end it should be clear to just about everyone what it
takes for me to lose weight.</p>

<h2>5) Develop at least 2 personal web projects.</h2>

<p>Blogs don&#8217;t count. These are serious sites that are not done for clients and
that I will be doing both the design and development. They will serve my #3
goal. For the past year I have been developing a lot of quality ideas for
projects and 2010 will be all about executing on (some) of them.</p>

<p>While client work does help to sharpen my existing skills it doesn&#8217;t really
help to push them in new directions. Working on these projects will help me
expand my expertise through working with new technologies.</p>

<h2>6) Finally get my passport, travel to a foreign country, and develop a</h2>

<p>proficiency in a second language</p>

<p>Some how I managed to not travel at all during the past year outside of
Oregon. Just about everyone else I know has used their time during this
depression to travel to Europe or some other continent. I was stuck here
focusing on sharpening my skills and helping my girlfriend get through her
final year of school. So one of my goals in 2010 is to finally get a passport
and to travel to another country. I am contemplating teaching English as a way
to get to either Japan or Korea.</p>

<p>Japan and Japanese is an obvious choice because I studied Japanese during
college and it is a place that I have always wanted to visit. To become
conversationally proficient would be possible in 6 months especially since I
am already familiar with the language and have numerous books and material on
it. Korean though would be a much greater challenge but since my girlfriend is
Korean I would have someone to personally converse with. Additionally my
girlfriend&#8217;s parents live in Korea and she has been looking for a good time to
go back there to take advantage of their awesome healthcare. It would be
incredible to be able to go there and visit them.</p>

<p>Regardless of where I end up I plan to stay for at least 1-3 months and to
continue doing freelance work during that time.</p>

<h2>7) Sell my car</h2>

<p>My &#8216;94 honda civic has been through quite a lot since I got it. It has been
stolen and then nearly totaled, all while parked outside of my duplex in a
quite cul de sac. During that time it has treated me very well, but once I get
to portland I plan to relieve myself of the burden of having a car and stick
to public transportation and my bikes.</p>

<p>I also have a lot of other minor goals that I would like to achieve that
include stuff like becoming a better programmer, cooking more and eating
healthier, becoming a better tennis player and going on near weekly photo
trips to better my photography. Those are all general things that aren&#8217;t very
measurable and living in Portland is certainly going to help with those.</p>

<p>The 7 goals I have mentioned are things that I want to passionately tackle
during the next year and reflect the direction that I want lead my life.</p>
