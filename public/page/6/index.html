<time datetime="2009-12-25T16:15:06-10:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 25<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The past year has been a tremendous year for personal growth (of not only my
gut) and I see 2010 as the year where I execute on what I have learned. I
believe one of the best ways of holding yourself accountable for your goals is
to put them in writing. So here are mine:</p>

<h2>1) Move to Portland.</h2>

<p>I moved to Eugene in January of 2005 to work for GarageGames. Right about the
time of what will be my 5 year anniversary of having moved here I will be
moving to Portland where my girlfriend and I will be sharing a house with
another couple until we can find and afford a place of our own. I don&#8217;t have a
job or any real prospects lined up and Portland has one of the highest rates
of unemployment in the nation, but compared to Eugene it has a heck of a lot
more going for it in just about every way that is important to us.</p>

<p>Coincidentally my girlfriend moved to Eugene during the same month as I did.
She completed her final term college this month and was able to finish her
Sociology degree. Remarkably, she was able to get a 4.0 (or better) in her
last 3 terms. By finishing up her degree we resolved the final reason for us
staying in Eugene. We both really adore Portland and so making the move there
is a huge step in the right direction for both of our futures.</p>

<h2>2) Continue to build out my Freelancing business</h2>

<p>One of my main reasons for moving to Portland is for the greater chance of
full-time employment, but at the same time I am not going to be waiting around
for companies to start hiring again.</p>

<p>The first half of the year really taught me what I value from myself and of my
professional life. It also taught me that I am pretty darn good at web
development and rekindled my love for it. My goal for the new year is to
continue getting freelance work and to <em>double my hourly rate</em>. I know
perfectly well that my current rate is actually well below what would be
considered standard for the quality of work that I do. But right now I am
concentrating on building up a portfolio of projects and work that I can use
to command the higher rate I deserve.</p>

<p>I registered an LLC in September and have since completed several projects
ranging from multiple Wordpress sites (including this one), Django powered
back-ends for iphone and heath care apps, and a Joomla site that required over
50 pages of content and a custom template and design. Every project has been
delivered on time and no doubt under budget.</p>

<p>All the projects that I have tackled so far have demonstrated expertise and
versatility in both front-and back-end web development, and my ability to
learn and adapt to changes quickly.</p>

<h2>3) Develop a passive income of at least $1000 a month</h2>

<p>The goal is to be able to generate enough income passively to be able to cover
my basic living expenses. The passive part is important. Passive income is
income that is generated by doing no additional work beyond the initial
investment. It happens regardless of whether you are sleeping or traveling.</p>

<p>The past year has shown me that I am capable of living fairly comfortably with
very little, all the while supporting my girlfriend through school and my mom
during this depression. Freelance work definitely has it highs and lows and
establishing a passive income enables me to take risks that I probably
wouldn&#8217;t be able to do otherwise because I&#8217;ll know that I have the freedom to
cover the necessities whether I am working or not.</p>

<p>I plan to do this with a combination of affiliate marketing sites as well as
ad revenue generated by some sides projects that I have in the works. This
goal will also help to facilitate goal #6.</p>

<h2>4) Lose 20 lbs.</h2>

<p>This goal is probably the closest I have to the typical new years resolution.
You would think that during a year where I have had the freedom to workout all
day/everyday I would be in tremendous shape. For the first half I actually was
because I basically worked-out and trained every day, but as I have focused
more on building my freelance career I have unfocused on other areas. I
haven&#8217;t touched a tennis racquet or seriously gone to the gym since October.
Starting January that is going to change quite drastically and more
importantly I will be holding myself accountable.</p>

<p>For me, 20 lbs should be easy. At the moment I weigh around 185 lbs. My lowest
since college was in 2006 where I got down to 155 lbs. 165 will be a happy
medium for me where I won&#8217;t be exceptionally lean but still be healthier
looking than I am presently.</p>

<p>I plan on achieving this weight loss the old fashion way - hard work and
dieting. I also plan to carefully document every workout that I do and every
food that I eat. By the end it should be clear to just about everyone what it
takes for me to lose weight.</p>

<h2>5) Develop at least 2 personal web projects.</h2>

<p>Blogs don&#8217;t count. These are serious sites that are not done for clients and
that I will be doing both the design and development. They will serve my #3
goal. For the past year I have been developing a lot of quality ideas for
projects and 2010 will be all about executing on (some) of them.</p>

<p>While client work does help to sharpen my existing skills it doesn&#8217;t really
help to push them in new directions. Working on these projects will help me
expand my expertise through working with new technologies.</p>

<h2>6) Finally get my passport, travel to a foreign country, and develop a</h2>

<p>proficiency in a second language</p>

<p>Some how I managed to not travel at all during the past year outside of
Oregon. Just about everyone else I know has used their time during this
depression to travel to Europe or some other continent. I was stuck here
focusing on sharpening my skills and helping my girlfriend get through her
final year of school. So one of my goals in 2010 is to finally get a passport
and to travel to another country. I am contemplating teaching English as a way
to get to either Japan or Korea.</p>

<p>Japan and Japanese is an obvious choice because I studied Japanese during
college and it is a place that I have always wanted to visit. To become
conversationally proficient would be possible in 6 months especially since I
am already familiar with the language and have numerous books and material on
it. Korean though would be a much greater challenge but since my girlfriend is
Korean I would have someone to personally converse with. Additionally my
girlfriend&#8217;s parents live in Korea and she has been looking for a good time to
go back there to take advantage of their awesome healthcare. It would be
incredible to be able to go there and visit them.</p>

<p>Regardless of where I end up I plan to stay for at least 1-3 months and to
continue doing freelance work during that time.</p>

<h2>7) Sell my car</h2>

<p>My &#8216;94 honda civic has been through quite a lot since I got it. It has been
stolen and then nearly totaled, all while parked outside of my duplex in a
quite cul de sac. During that time it has treated me very well, but once I get
to portland I plan to relieve myself of the burden of having a car and stick
to public transportation and my bikes.</p>

<p>I also have a lot of other minor goals that I would like to achieve that
include stuff like becoming a better programmer, cooking more and eating
healthier, becoming a better tennis player and going on near weekly photo
trips to better my photography. Those are all general things that aren&#8217;t very
measurable and living in Portland is certainly going to help with those.</p>

<p>The 7 goals I have mentioned are things that I want to passionately tackle
during the next year and reflect the direction that I want lead my life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in about 2003 I was really getting into listening to music. I was tired
of lame computer speakers and my gameboy headphones from 1989 were no longer
cutting it. To satisfy my desire to have clear, quality audio I got a pair of
<a href="http://gradolabs.com/product_pages/sr80.htm">Grado SR-80</a> headphones. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grado_Labs">Grado
Labs</a> isn&#8217;t as famous to the average
music enthusiast as Sennheiser or Sony but around Hi-Fi audiophiles Grado has
made a name for themselves for providing a very crisp, neutral sound that is
true to the source material.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7637913@N07/3746485759/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/374648%0A5759_a7558de632_z.jpg" alt="kickin it with old school style" /></a>G
rado Labs is based out of Brooklyn and is a family owned business with the
sole purpose of manufacturing quality high-end audio products and it shows.
They make a wide range of headphones going from $49 iGrado street-style
headphones all the way up to crazy $1695 PS1000. The SR-80s were about $95
when I bought them. The main selling point for me was that they offered a
sound that was comparable to headphones that cost significantly more. If your
experience with headphones is limited to the cheap white ones that came with
your ipod then you are missing out on lot of detail in your music.</p>

<p>In about 2005 my headphones died due to a loose connection in one of the
drivers - probably because of over use. After a brief attempt at repairing
them myself which resulted in a mess of solder, I gave up not wanting to risk
doing more damage. In May of 2007 I was still bummed that these great
headphones were going to waste because of a tiny wire so I decided to send a
message to Grado to see if they could repair them. Despite the fact that the
headphones were a few years old they told me to send it in to the factory.</p>

<p>Holy Crap could a company really be that cool?</p>

<p>Thanks to my laziness I wouldn&#8217;t find out for another 2 years. At the
beginning of July I decided to take a chance and mailed off the headphones
along with a letter explaining my situation. I figured my options were to
either trash these headphones which were going on nearly 3 years of not being
used or to send them off to Grado where the worst that could happen is that
they would be recycled.</p>

<p>Well today I got an unexpected delivery in the mail from Grado. In the box
were my repaired headphones free of charge and they sound as good as they ever
have.</p>

<p>Thank you so much Grado!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since getting a D40 back in March a lot has happened. I have really grown to
love photography and look forward to every trip and hike as an excuse to take
more pictures. I have gobbled up several books on the subject and have since
invested in a new lens and flash. I seldom go anywhere now without a camera.</p>

<p>I realized within a month of getting the D40 that I was going to out grow it
fast. It’s a great camera that takes amazing exposures and easily recommend it
over point and shoot cameras that cost more - but there are several
limitations that I won&#8217;t cover here. Since I was happy with Nikon in general I
knew I would want to stay with their line of cameras. So my options were to
upgrade to the D80 or splurge on a D300. The D80 has long been at the end of
its product cycle - so while I could get it affordably I knew it wouldn&#8217;t be
the upgrade that I really wanted. The D300 is considered one of the best
cameras to come out in the past year and is without a doubt my ideal upgrade.
But the cost was prohibitive. I enjoy photography but I am not willing to
spend upwards of $2k on a camera at this point.</p>

<p>Enter the D90.</p>

<p>The D90 has had an interesting journey. Those who follow DSLRs have known that
Nikon was certainly working on this camera. The D80 - while be very popular -
was looking long in the tooth compared to recent offerings by Canon. Most
notably the lack of LiveView and an old image sensor. This lead people to
theorize what would make a worthy successor. The dream was a D80 combined with
the award winning features of the D300. Nikon managed to deliver on that dream
and more.</p>

<p>The D90 inherits the D300 image sensor. Meaning it&#8217;s megapixel count has been
bumped to 12 and it&#8217;s sensitivity has increased dramatically over the D80
(from 3200 to 6400). It&#8217;s LCD has been increased to 3 inches and has gained
Live View. In what many consider the biggest surprise the D90 is the first
DSLR to include video recording. Though this is probably the feature that I am
the least excited about.</p>

<p>A full feature comparison and &#8220;preview&#8221; can be found
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0808/08082702nikond90previewed.asp">here</a>. Chase
Jarvis did a fun post and video on the camera. You can find it
<a href="http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/2008/08/chase-jarvis-raw-advance-%0Atesting-nikon.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I had planned on waiting until October or November for the body only release
of the D90 - but the combination of an upcoming vacation and a friend&#8217;s
wedding had made me want to upgrade sooner. I had been saving up in
anticipation of the upgrade for a while so I was ready to purchase it whenever
it was available. On Monday I found out the local Best Buy had a one and
reserved it but I still wasn&#8217;t certain as to whether I should make the
purchase as I am hesitant about making any big purchase. I shopped around at
the local camera stores and no one else had it in stock and luckily for me
Best Buy offered no interest financing for 2 years. That sealed the deal for
me - happy belated birthday to myself. I may very well be one of the first
people in Eugene with a D90.</p>

<p>So how is it?</p>

<p>Its everything I hoped for and more. It is a gigantic upgrade over my D40
while providing all the important features that I needed from the D300. There
are some things that I will probably miss (weather proofing, lens focus
tuning) but I can live without those for now. Shooting without a flash at
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7637913@N07/sets/72157607086403265/">PAX</a> on a
D40 revealed a lot more noise than I would have liked. In comparison the D90
is able to take great looking pictures at 3200 where the D40 was barely able
to get by at 1600. Also I am able to use auto-focus on primes like my 50mm
1.8.</p>

<p>One of the major features I wanted from a D80 was the flash commander mode.
This allows you to use flashes off camera and control them from the camera. I
plan to get into <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/">Strobist</a> like photography in
the future.</p>

<p>I plan on selling the kit lens that came with it. While it is apparently a
good lens and well reviewed - I don&#8217;t need it. I bought a Tamron 17-50 2.8
lens a few months back and have since not had a reason to use any of my other
lenses. So if anyone wants a 18-105 VR lens before it is sold in stores, I am
willing to part with it unused and with the warranty for $300.</p>

<p>Additionally my D40 is now for sale. I am willing to part with it and the
original kit lens for $300. That includes a spare battery. For $150 more I
will throw in my 55-200 VR kit lens. The D40 kit still sells for new at $460
at most stores - you can get it used with the 55-200 VR for less than that
from me. My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7637913@N07/">flickr account</a> is
filled with pictures that I took with this camera.</p>
