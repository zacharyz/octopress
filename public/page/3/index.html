<p>This picture represents a special memory for me. Not only was it an absolute
perfect night for photography but I also had a chance to take a picture of the
rare occurance of a <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/">super moon</a>.</p>

<p>This is one of the final pictures I took after a day of touring London. By
this point my entire body was complaining and I still had an hour long walk
ahead of me back to my hostel. Despite the pain I was incredibly happy to be
doing what I was where I was doing it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I leave on a cheap flight to spend the weekend in Paris - another
first for me. Thanks for viewing!</p>

<p>I woke up Saturday morning in a London hostel and then proceeded to spend the
next 10 hours touring the city - mostly on foot. The entire time I lugged
around my tripod wondering if I should have left the thing at home.</p>

<p>Then the sun set and I was treated to London at night in the form of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square">Trafalagar Square</a> making my
sore shoulders and feet worth it.</p>

<p>I am spending a month working in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The weather here isn&#8217;t exactly pleasant. The strange combination of cold,
wind, rain and snow means I am not spending much time outdoors. On my walks to
and from work I am bundled up and am amazed to see people going for jogs or
riding their bikes without their face or heads covered while it is raining and
freezing.</p>

<p>My time here has actually been healthier than usual despite being in a foreign
country. I chalk this up to two factors: 1) My apartment/hotel has a clean
pool and decent weight room 2) the food here is pretty lackluster. Combine
those traits with the craptastic weather and I have yet to really leave my
apartment except to go to work.</p>

<p>I feel zero desire to eat out because everything is bland and over priced and
I am working out and swimming every day. Food wise I have been following a
slow-carb diet which does away with carbs like sugars, pastas and breads. So
it is mostly vegetables and proteins. My most common meal has been eggs, beans
and some frozen vegetables. Yummy.</p>

<p>At the office we get catered lunches. Everyone always complains about the
quality but it is a perk that I definitely appreciate and don&#8217;t get to take
advantage of because I work remotely. There is just enough variety that I
don&#8217;t have to deviate from my diet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5514732854/"><img class="right" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5140/5514732854_4ce4d6fee6_d.jpg"></a></p>

<p>I plan to spend my first weekend here decompressing from a busy but productive
week of work by mostly reading on my kindle. The weather is going to be decent
- at least rain and snow isn&#8217;t on the forecast. I hope to be able to get out
and grab some more pictures or chill in a cafe some place.</p>

<p>The upcoming weekends should be more interesting though. So far I have booked
weekend trips to London and Paris. It will be my first time traveling to
either place. Both flights have me leaving Friday after work and returning
Sunday night. Once you are in Europe it is pretty remarkable where you can
travel to for 100-200 bucks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314864412/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5314864412_b8f2048fd4_b.jpg" alt="View at Mount Hood" /></a></p>

<p>I have been living in Portland for just about a year now. One of the big draws
of Portland was how close it was to Mount Hood and we envisioned heading to
this place every weekend. In reality we didn&#8217;t even go once the entire year. I
wanted to start the year off differently though and celebrate it with a snow
boarding trip. Despite the cost and the fear of it being extremely crowded
given the fresh snow and weekend it turned out to be fantastic.</p>

<p>All the pictures taken for this post were made with my iphone. While I would
have loved to have used my DSLR there, some times the best camera is the one
you have with you. I use an app called AutoStitch which creates a panorama
from a bunch of pictures. Most of the panoramas that I take use anywhere from
three to nine pictures.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I learned how to board together a few years ago. We go very
sporadicly, so every time it feels like we have to learn the basics over
again. By the time we are finish we feel like we know what we are doing but
then the process repeats itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314866632/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5201/5314866632_b7853a7835_b.jpg" title="Snow Boarding Pro" ></a></p>

<p>We don&#8217;t own a 4wd vehicle so we used a bus service to get to Mount Hood. This
involves parking our car some place, then sleeping on the bus for 2 hours
while the driver deals with parking and the snow. Once there we rented the
boards and boots.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314268817/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5314268817_1c2fcae95b_b.jpg" alt="Tough Spot" /></a></p>

<p>On my very first run my worst fear happened: I had no idea how to interpret
the route signs and some how stumbled upon a run that was way above my level.
I quickly lost momentum and found myself surrounded by trees in fresh, deep
snow. When I tried to move myself I would sink into the snow. The weather was
absolutely perfect though and I didn&#8217;t really care. At one point I found
myself at the top of a very steep hill that looked very dangerous. I butt slid
around and eventually realized that I was surrounded by similar tracks.
Apparently I wasn&#8217;t the only person to recently be in the same situation.
Eventually I pushed and hiked my way through the snow until I got to a clear
hill and was on my way again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5318278146/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5318278146_155bae42da_b.jpg" title="Cascade Express" ></a></p>

<p>After spending some time around the newbie coarse I eventually became more
comfortable riding the snow board and decided to make my way up the mountain.
After taking the above picture I was entranced by the beauty of the mountain,
only to realize shortly afterwards that I was no longer holding my glove. I
glanced over my shoulder just as it hit the snow. I spent the rest of the trip
trying to memorize a route to my glove and planning how the heck I would get
down there without my glove. I opted to use my inner fleece as a glove (which
worked horribly) and had to make frequent stops to warm my hand. Shortly
before reaching it though another boarder had picked it up and deposited it at
the entrance. Thanks man!</p>

<p>Despite worrying about my glove I couldn&#8217;t help but snap the above panorama at
Cascade Express.</p>

<p>Throughout the day I couldn&#8217;t help but appreciate just how lucky I was to be
where I was - perfect weather and snow, tearing down a beautiful mountain. It
was an amazing way to celebrate the end of an awesome year and the beginning
of a new one.</p>

<p>I was in Montreal for the past week to attend <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite 2010</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first time that I have traveled to Canada, so add one more country
to the <em>list</em> of new countries I have visited this year.</p>

<p>Montreal felt very European to me with its architecture and cobble stone
streets. This contrasted greatly with the people who lived there. At one
moment I could be sitting next to a group of people speaking perfect English
as they discussed video games, then in the next I would be surrounded by
people who only spoke French.</p>

<div class='image' id='5167757288'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5167757288/><img class='center' src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5167757288_c1c00694a8_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Old Town Montreal Panorama</span></h2></div>


<p>I am not used to being so well treated on a company trip. I am used to sharing
cheap motels with co-workers as we tested how many we can pile in a single
room. For this trip each of us were setup in 4 star hotels in the middle of
Old Town Montreal, just a block away from the [Notre-Dame Basilica of</p>

<p>Overall Montreal was a beautiful city with nice people and great food I just
wish I didn&#8217;t get sick mid-trip and was able to appreciate it more.</p>
