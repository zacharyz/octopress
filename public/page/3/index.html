  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314864412/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5314864412_b8f2048fd4_b.jpg" alt="View at Mount Hood" /></a></p>

<p>I have been living in Portland for just about a year now. One of the big draws
of Portland was how close it was to Mount Hood and we envisioned heading to
this place every weekend. In reality we didn&#8217;t even go once the entire year. I
wanted to start the year off differently though and celebrate it with a snow
boarding trip. Despite the cost and the fear of it being extremely crowded
given the fresh snow and weekend it turned out to be fantastic.</p>

<p>All the pictures taken for this post were made with my iphone. While I would
have loved to have used my DSLR there, some times the best camera is the one
you have with you. I use an app called AutoStitch which creates a panorama
from a bunch of pictures. Most of the panoramas that I take use anywhere from
three to nine pictures.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I learned how to board together a few years ago. We go very
sporadicly, so every time it feels like we have to learn the basics over
again. By the time we are finish we feel like we know what we are doing but
then the process repeats itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314866632/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5201/5314866632_b7853a7835_b.jpg" title="Snow Boarding Pro" ></a></p>

<p>We don&#8217;t own a 4wd vehicle so we used a bus service to get to Mount Hood. This
involves parking our car some place, then sleeping on the bus for 2 hours
while the driver deals with parking and the snow. Once there we rented the
boards and boots.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314268817/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5314268817_1c2fcae95b_b.jpg" alt="Tough Spot" /></a></p>

<p>On my very first run my worst fear happened: I had no idea how to interpret
the route signs and some how stumbled upon a run that was way above my level.
I quickly lost momentum and found myself surrounded by trees in fresh, deep
snow. When I tried to move myself I would sink into the snow. The weather was
absolutely perfect though and I didn&#8217;t really care. At one point I found
myself at the top of a very steep hill that looked very dangerous. I butt slid
around and eventually realized that I was surrounded by similar tracks.
Apparently I wasn&#8217;t the only person to recently be in the same situation.
Eventually I pushed and hiked my way through the snow until I got to a clear
hill and was on my way again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5318278146/"><img class="center" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5318278146_155bae42da_b.jpg" title="Cascade Express" ></a></p>

<p>After spending some time around the newbie coarse I eventually became more
comfortable riding the snow board and decided to make my way up the mountain.
After taking the above picture I was entranced by the beauty of the mountain,
only to realize shortly afterwards that I was no longer holding my glove. I
glanced over my shoulder just as it hit the snow. I spent the rest of the trip
trying to memorize a route to my glove and planning how the heck I would get
down there without my glove. I opted to use my inner fleece as a glove (which
worked horribly) and had to make frequent stops to warm my hand. Shortly
before reaching it though another boarder had picked it up and deposited it at
the entrance. Thanks man!</p>

<p>Despite worrying about my glove I couldn&#8217;t help but snap the above panorama at
Cascade Express.</p>

<p>Throughout the day I couldn&#8217;t help but appreciate just how lucky I was to be
where I was - perfect weather and snow, tearing down a beautiful mountain. It
was an amazing way to celebrate the end of an awesome year and the beginning
of a new one.</p>

<p>I was in Montreal for the past week to attend <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite 2010</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first time that I have traveled to Canada, so add one more country
to the <em>list</em> of new countries I have visited this year.</p>

<p>Montreal felt very European to me with its architecture and cobble stone
streets. This contrasted greatly with the people who lived there. At one
moment I could be sitting next to a group of people speaking perfect English
as they discussed video games, then in the next I would be surrounded by
people who only spoke French.</p>

<div class="image" id="5167757288"></div>


<p>I am not used to being so well treated on a company trip. I am used to sharing
cheap motels with co-workers as we tested how many we can pile in a single
room. For this trip each of us were setup in 4 star hotels in the middle of
Old Town Montreal, just a block away from the [Notre-Dame Basilica of</p>

<div class="image" id="5167753868"></div>


<p>Overall Montreal was a beautiful city with nice people and great food I just
wish I didn&#8217;t get sick mid-trip and was able to appreciate it more.</p>

<p>The Gorge is absolutely stunning right now. The water levels are high and the
trees are filled with oranges and yellows. If you can find a dry enough day as
I was lucky enough to this weekend then you need to do yourself a favor and
make your way out there before all the color disappears.</p>

<div class="image" id="5137536926"></div>


<p>This was my first hike in my Vibram Five Finger Trek shoes and it was a
breeze. They handled the rocky uphill climb with ease and were still
comfortable after I waded into the cold water to get the shots that I wanted.</p>

<p>It was good to see a healthy amount of photographers out with tripods (I
counted about ten). I don&#8217;t think people realize how much better their
waterfall shots will be if they use one as it is nearly impossible to get a
sharp shot that has that silky water effect that can only be achieved by
having a shot that is exposed for 1-2 seconds. One guy had a $3000 camera and
was convinced he didn&#8217;t need to use my tripod when I offered it because he
felt that his expensive camera would be enough.</p>

<p>Towards the end of our stay in Zurich Switzerland we decided that we wanted to
find a good view of the city. The local city information guide recommended
that be board a tram and take it up to the zoo.</p>

<p>It was already late in the day and the zoo was closed, so when we arrived
there was no one else around. For a moment I was worried that we would be
stranded. Around where we were there was no obvious view.</p>

<p>Eventually I struck up the courage to try and ask a local if he had any idea
where we might find the view that the guide had referred to. He didn&#8217;t speak a
bit of English but after a few silly gestures from myself - a huge smile
formed on a his face and he knew exactly what we were looking for.</p>

<div class="image" id="4866237215"></div>


<p>A short walk past a simply amazing field of sunflowers revealed a spectacular
view of the city. From there we could see the Alps in the distance as well as
the beautiful city in its entirety.</p>

<p>Zurich is a very expensive city to do anything in, but for the price of a tram
pass we were treated to a very special view that I feel few tourists are
treated to.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful city.</p>

<p>When I was in high-school I used to run on the cross-country team. It was a
way for me to train in the off seasons between baseball and wrestling.
Eventually I actually became decent recording my fastest 5k time at around 19
minutes, which translates to about a 6 minute mile pace.</p>

<p>It was never easy and I never enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I remember starting every race without imagining what it would be like to
finish it. I simply put one foot in front of the other and kept pace with a
buddy until I could see the finish line - then I would sprint across it like a
mad man and puke my guts out.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3291/3015371980_6874e1ab49.jpg" title="Cross Country with Michael" ></p>

<p>I kept it up a little bit in college but over the years simply gave up on it. I think
around 5 years ago I was still able to run at an 8 minute mile pace.
Eventually though my knee began to hurt when I ran. Without a doubt my pains
are a result of years of playing tennis aggressively. There was a point when I
was playing almost daily that I couldn&#8217;t imagine there being a ball that I
wouldn&#8217;t try to track down and return. One day though something clicked and
since then there wasn&#8217;t a hitting session or run that wouldn&#8217;t end with my
knee swelling up and me being barely able to walk for a day.</p>

<p>I asked a doctor what could be done. He looked at my knee and determined that
there wasn&#8217;t anything toren but there was a build up of cartilage that would
require surgery to remove. His advice: give up tennis - it simply wasn&#8217;t worth
going through surgery when my knee was only aggravated when I played tennis.</p>

<p>As you could imagine this didn&#8217;t sit well with me - after all tennis is
something that I love. It did force me to evaluate what exactly it was about
tennis that caused my knee to hurt. My conclusion was that it was caused by
the constant pounding, starting and stopping that occurs during tennis - all
of which is felt by my knee. Tennis shoes have an immense amount of padding on
the heel which only encourages you to drive your foot harder into the ground.</p>

<p>The more my knee hurt that more I hated myself for not running over the years.
I missed the days when I used to be able to fly across a field faster than the
wind. Now the very thought of it would cause my knee to ache.</p>

<p>My running stride in the past has always been very long. Where each stride I
would drive my heel into the ground and bound off of it like a deer. I used to
want to replicate the covers of running magazines that I saw when I was a kid.
Running shoes by their very nature encourage this type of stride despite how
un-natural it is. Try it for yourself - take off your shoes and go run across
a field. You will find that you will naturally land on the balls of your feet.</p>

<p>The human foot is the result of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution
and yet a couple of decades of marketing by shoe manufacturers have convinced
people that it is flawed and that they should be <em>corrected</em>. It was this line
of reasoning and the book Born to Run that lead me to buying the craziest
looking shoes that I had ever seen - Vibram Five Fingers.</p>

<p>I had put off buying a pair for well over a year. First because they aren&#8217;t
exactly good looking, and second because I had a perfectly good pair of
running shoes. The selection of these expensive running shoes were the result
of going to a running store and having my stride recorded and analyzed so that
I would have the perfect running shoe for my feet. Compared to any other shoe
that I had ever had - running in these felt great. The only problem though is
that whenever I ran fast, I would go into my comfortable stride that involved
driving my heels into the ground which would lead to my knee hurting and me
regretting my decision to run.</p>

<p>The basic point of Vibram Five Finger shoes is to replicate what it is like to
be barefooted while still having the excellent traction and durability of a
Vibram sole. I went with the KSO (keep stuff out) trek model. Vibram makes a
model that is geared specifically towards road running, but I wanted something
that I could take on trails while still looking some what inconspicuous. The
average VFF has wild colors that I think most VFF enthusiasts appreciate
because they love the attention that they bring. I just wanted to be able to
run pain free.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5029224752_a4d697649d.jpg"></p>

<p>It has been about 10 days since I got my pair of VFF. During that time I have
logged 21 miles and ran more consistently than I have ever before - or been
able to in the past. It feels awesome to wake up and actually want to be able
to run again instead of dreading the pain that would follow.</p>

<p>My stride has changed drastically. I have been trying for the past year to run
on the balls of my feet, but VFF make it so much easier. Instead of long
strides I now take short, quick steps that land below my center of gravity
rather than in front of it.</p>

<p>The result of this new way of running is that my stride is way more economical
than it used to be and my dropping 5k time is proof of it. I now feel like I
can run longer and faster than before. Best of all my knee doesn&#8217;t hurt at all
after a run or even a weeks worth of runs. I have gone from running on average
15 miles a month at the beginning of the year - all which ended in pain - to
over 50 this month alone.</p>

<p>I have years to make up before I will be able to run at the speed that I ran
in high-school but thanks to Vibram Five Fingers I feel like it is possible
that I will be able to. As an added bonus in the last month I have lost 10
pounds as a result of running again. I still have about 20 pounds more to go
until I reach one of my goals of the year of getting down to 160 but thanks to
my new found love of running I am feeling lighter and healthier than I have
all year.</p>
