  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314864412/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5314864412_b8f2048fd4_b.jpg" alt="View at Mount Hood" /></a></p>

<p>I have been living in Portland for just about a year now. One of the big draws
of Portland was how close it was to Mount Hood and we envisioned heading to
this place every weekend. In reality we didn&#8217;t even go once the entire year. I
wanted to start the year off differently though and celebrate it with a snow
boarding trip. Despite the cost and the fear of it being extremely crowded
given the fresh snow and weekend it turned out to be fantastic.</p>

<p>All the pictures taken for this post were made with my iphone. While I would
have loved to have used my DSLR there, some times the best camera is the one
you have with you. I use an app called AutoStitch which creates a panorama
from a bunch of pictures. Most of the panoramas that I take use anywhere from
three to nine pictures.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I learned how to board together a few years ago. We go very
sporadicly, so every time it feels like we have to learn the basics over
again. By the time we are finish we feel like we know what we are doing but
then the process repeats itself.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t own a 4wd vehicle so we used a bus service to get to Mount Hood. This
involves parking our car some place, then sleeping on the bus for 2 hours
while the driver deals with parking and the snow. Once there we rented the
boards and boots.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314268817/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5314268817_1c2fcae95b_b.jpg" alt="Tough Spot" /></a></p>

<p>On my very first run my worst fear happened: I had no idea how to interpret
the route signs and some how stumbled upon a run that was way above my level.
I quickly lost momentum and found myself surrounded by trees in fresh, deep
snow. When I tried to move myself I would sink into the snow. The weather was
absolutely perfect though and I didn&#8217;t really care. At one point I found
myself at the top of a very steep hill that looked very dangerous. I butt slid
around and eventually realized that I was surrounded by similar tracks.
Apparently I wasn&#8217;t the only person to recently be in the same situation.
Eventually I pushed and hiked my way through the snow until I got to a clear
hill and was on my way again.</p>

<p>After spending some time around the newbie coarse I eventually became more
comfortable riding the snow board and decided to make my way up the mountain.
After taking the above picture I was entranced by the beauty of the mountain,
only to realize shortly afterwards that I was no longer holding my glove. I
glanced over my shoulder just as it hit the snow. I spent the rest of the trip
trying to memorize a route to my glove and planning how the heck I would get
down there without my glove. I opted to use my inner fleece as a glove (which
worked horribly) and had to make frequent stops to warm my hand. Shortly
before reaching it though another boarder had picked it up and deposited it at
the entrance. Thanks man!</p>

<p>Despite worrying about my glove I couldn&#8217;t help but snap the above panorama at
Cascade Express.</p>

<p>Throughout the day I couldn&#8217;t help but appreciate just how lucky I was to be
where I was - perfect weather and snow, tearing down a beautiful mountain. It
was an amazing way to celebrate the end of an awesome year and the beginning
of a new one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://30at30.zadell.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/30pounds.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5163/5247320766_bb6be9ff9e.jpg"></p>

<p>I was actually confused this morning when I looked at my scale. I was
expecting to see 161 or 162 and hadn&#8217;t expected to lose that last pound for
another few days. Coming back from my last trip where I was consistently
hovering just barely over 170 - loseit kept predicting my completion date as
getting ever closer to the end of the year. This made me think more and more
than it was unreasonable to lose 30 pounds in the time frame I wanted.</p>

<p>This past week I have had only one thing in mind with regards to my diet - eat
whatever I wanted to as long as I was under budget.
Loseit lists ice-cream as one of my favorite foods. This shows me that a large part of losing
weight is really about managing <em>how much</em> you eat.</p>

<p>For the first few months I ran and exercised like a mad man, which made me
feel great. Then when I was injured I didn&#8217;t have the luxury of knowing that I
would be able to eat those 400-600 more calories thanks to my run. Loading up
on calories can be incredibly easy - a bag of chips, some ice-cream, eating
out. Bam - you just consumed more calories than your body can burn. So the
important thing for me was learning to manage my portions and how much I ate.</p>

<p>Now comes another challenge - not putting it all back on again.</p>

<p>My ankle is beginning to feel good enough to run on again and I am starting to
do more body weight exercises. I no doubt lost <em>some</em> muscle over the last
year and half where I didn&#8217;t lift consistently so a part of me wants to try
and put that back on.</p>

<p>For now though I am thrilled to be going into the New Year knowing that I was
able to actually accomplish a weight loss goal.</p>

<p>Those last 10 pounds took quite a bit longer than the first. Because of this I
almost feel like I have lost some perspective on how big a change it was for
me. My self image increased drastically going from 180-170. The first 10 were
rewarding but I couldn&#8217;t really see the difference, with these last 10 it is
much more apparent.</p>

<p>I now have a BMI below 24.2, which means I am now at <em>normal weight</em>.</p>

<p>It was actually towards the end of October that I saw hints of being this low.
After major runs or tennis I would be in the low 170s. I figured with the way
I was going I would be in the 160s in no time. Then a couple of weeks ago (to
this day) I did something really dumb and ran on a strained ankle. Two weeks
later and that ankle is still hurting because of it. Then I went on a near
week long business trip that really tested my dieting resolve. Mid-way through
that I caught a cold - which I have spent the week fighting off. So the last
couple of weeks have put a major damper on my weight loss. I would guess the
last 3-4 pounds that I have lost have been exclusively because of dieting,
which is odd to me because I have relied so much on exercising for the first
16 pounds.</p>

<p>Today means I only have 8.8 pounds to go before I reach my goal of getting to
160. That number looks way smaller than 20 did a month and a half ago but it
looks huge when you consider that I will be attempting it by New Years -
especially during the holidays.</p>

<p>Part of my motivation for doing it before the New Year is so that I will be
able to go into the new year knowing that I am already at a good weight. So
instead of having to make yet another New Year&#8217;s resolution of having to lose
weight I can make something else - like putting weight on (muscle), or even
just maintaining my weight.</p>

<p>Knowing how hard it was to lose these last 10 pounds makes me question if it
is even possible to lose another before the year ends with Thanksgiving and
Christmas coming up. We&#8217;ll see how well that goes.</p>

<p>I was in Montreal for the past week to attend <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite 2010</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first time that I have traveled to Canada, so add one more country
to the <em>list</em> of new countries I have visited this year.</p>

<p>Montreal felt very European to me with its architecture and cobble stone
streets. This contrasted greatly with the people who lived there. At one
moment I could be sitting next to a group of people speaking perfect English
as they discussed video games, then in the next I would be surrounded by
people who only spoke French.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5167757288/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5167757288_c1c00694a8_b.jpg" alt="Old Town Montreal Panorama" /></a></p>

<p>I am not used to being so well treated on a company trip. I am used to sharing
cheap motels with co-workers as we tested how many we can pile in a single
room. For this trip each of us were setup in 4 star hotels in the middle of
Old Town Montreal, just a block away from the [Notre-Dame Basilica of</p>

<p>Overall Montreal was a beautiful city with nice people and great food I just
wish I didn&#8217;t get sick mid-trip and was able to appreciate it more.</p>

<p>The Gorge is absolutely stunning right now. The water levels are high and the
trees are filled with oranges and yellows. If you can find a dry enough day as
I was lucky enough to this weekend then you need to do yourself a favor and
make your way out there before all the color disappears.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5137536926/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5137536926_0691dc3087_b.jpg" alt="Multnomah Falls at Fall" /></a></p>

<p>This was my first hike in my Vibram Five Finger Trek shoes and it was a
breeze. They handled the rocky uphill climb with ease and were still
comfortable after I waded into the cold water to get the shots that I wanted.</p>

<p>It was good to see a healthy amount of photographers out with tripods (I
counted about ten). I don&#8217;t think people realize how much better their
waterfall shots will be if they use one as it is nearly impossible to get a
sharp shot that has that silky water effect that can only be achieved by
having a shot that is exposed for 1-2 seconds. One guy had a $3000 camera and
was convinced he didn&#8217;t need to use my tripod when I offered it because he
felt that his expensive camera would be enough.</p>

<p>Towards the end of our stay in Zurich Switzerland we decided that we wanted to
find a good view of the city. The local city information guide recommended
that be board a tram and take it up to the zoo.</p>

<p>It was already late in the day and the zoo was closed, so when we arrived
there was no one else around. For a moment I was worried that we would be
stranded. Around where we were there was no obvious view.</p>

<p>Eventually I struck up the courage to try and ask a local if he had any idea
where we might find the view that the guide had referred to. He didn&#8217;t speak a
bit of English but after a few silly gestures from myself - a huge smile
formed on a his face and he knew exactly what we were looking for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4866237215/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4866237215_777ed3e365_b.jpg" alt="Zurich" /></a></p>

<p>A short walk past a simply amazing field of sunflowers revealed a spectacular
view of the city. From there we could see the Alps in the distance as well as
the beautiful city in its entirety.</p>

<p>Zurich is a very expensive city to do anything in, but for the price of a tram
pass we were treated to a very special view that I feel few tourists are
treated to.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful city.</p>

<p>In just over 3 weeks I have made it 1/3rd a way through my goal of losing 30
pounds and weighing 160. I woke up this morning after refueling with my cheat
day to weigh 180.</p>

<p>It hasn&#8217;t been easy - but it has been fun. During this past month I have
logged more miles running than ever before. According to Nike+ I have logged
about 20 miles in the past week alone and lowered my 5k time below 30 minutes.
Not bad for someone who only recently completed the Couch to 5k program about
10 days ago.</p>

<p>For the next 10 pounds I plan to incorporate more weight training with kettle
bells as well as some jiu jitsu training. This past month has been all cardio
and I fear that I might plateau if I don&#8217;t mix it up.</p>
