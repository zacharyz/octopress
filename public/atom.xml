<p>Spring is starting to peak it&#8217;s head out from the rain and the snow here in Oregon. I
thought I would take advantage of the opportunity and spend the weekend at the coast
shooting Haystack Rock at Cannon Beach.</p>

<p>The weekend promised clear skies and warm weather (for the Oregon Coast at least). Unfortunately I was cheated out of a glorious sunset and instead had to settle for this.</p>

<p>Despite my inactivity for posting pictures over the last 6 months - photography has still been on
my mind. The new year has brought about a ton of postive changes and I
am as excited as ever.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for many more pictures to come in 2012.</p>

<h2>You In?</h2>

<p>About 10 days ago I got an email from one of the friends I climbed Hood with
asking if I wanted to climb Rainier. It contained a short description of the
hike and ended with &#8220;It will be a miserable and wonderful experience. You in?&#8221;</p>

<p>He honestly didn&#8217;t even need to ask. Even after it was all over and I could
barely stand, when simple things like opening a beer would cause me to cramp
up, did I feel the same way as I did then - of course I was in.</p>

<p>I think I have reached a stage in my life where simply because something is
difficult is not reason enough not to do it. When I look back at the past year
one of the things I think of most fondly is my Summit of Hood back in June.
Whenever I am about Portland and I catch a glimpse of Hood I can&#8217;t help but
feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment knowing that I conquered such a
gigantic mountain.</p>

<p>What better gift to myself than to be able to claim that I conquered another
mountain?</p>

<div class='image' id='6070864990'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/6070864990/><img class='center' src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6070864990_fe656c11ce_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Little Tahoma and the Glacier</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<h2>What&#8217;s Involved</h2>

<p>The Rainier summit is at 14,411 ft compared to Hood&#8217;s 11,249 ft. In several of
my shots there is a mountain called Little Tahoma that seems tiny when on the
mountain. It is actually only 100 ft smaller than Mount Hood.</p>

<p>This climb up Rainier is much longer than Hood was. The very last part of
Hood, where you need an ice axe to self bellet yourself is probably more
technically challenging than anything I encountered on Rainier, but beyond
that Rainier is in a different league of difficulty because of the endurance
you will need.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that someone went from the parking lot to the top of the mountain
and back in 5 hours. We would be traveling with a 90 liter pack filled with
gear, food and clothing, which would mean we would be traveling much slower
than he did.</p>

<div class='image' id='6070277665'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/6070277665/><img class='center' src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6070277665_f10288fa08_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Rainier Sunrise</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<p>Weight was always on my mind. None of my gear is particularly light. My pack
is about 15 years old and no where near being ideal for climbing mountains
with. I elected to leave my relatively heavy Nikon D90 + Sigma 10-20 combo that I
adored on Hood home in exchange for a much lighter (if damaged) Canon G9. My
G9 has been through quite a bit so it is filled with dust and if I ever tried
to change its focal length it would lock up and give a lens error. I really
wish I could have spared the weight but realize that many of the shots that I
did get would not have happened if I had to fumble through my pack constantly
to retrive my camera.</p>

<p>The hike involves leaving early in the morning from the
Paradise parking lot with all your gear. From there you will travel roughly 4
hours to Camp Muir. The trip up was relatively easy. I was fresh and my pack
felt light. Despite the length of the hike most of the people doing it were
approaching it as a day hike - so up to Camp Muir and back.</p>

<p>Like many others though we were in it to go all the way. We arrived at Muir
shortly after noon and then spent the next 12 hours sleeping, filtering water
and cooking. We were really concerned about having to carry a tent so we
sprinted to Muir to make sure that we had a spot in the first come first serve
hut that is available to climbers for free.</p>

<div class='image' id='6070260203'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/6070260203/><img class='center' src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6070260203_c0f96e8dee_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Camp Muir Sunset</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<p>We were able to get good spots and shortly after the place filled up with people who would be
waking up the same time as we did to tackle the mountain. It seems everyone
had the same plan and woke up around midnight to eat some breakfast, gear up
and head out for what would be much more difficult climb than the first half of
the mountain.</p>

<p>By the end of the climb I was so exhausted that I had to break frequently to
make the short walk to the actual summit. Without realizing it I was nearly on
the verge of tears as we celebrated the climb. Was it the hardest thing I had
ever done? Maybe. Most exhausting? Definitely.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the experience was realizing you had to climb
all the way back down again though. Shale and sliding snow made for a really
uncomfortable trip down.</p>

<h2>How long does it take?</h2>

<p>Total trip broke down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hike to Camp Muir: 4 hours</li>
<li>Resting at Camp Muir then waking up at midnight: 12 hours</li>
<li>Hiking from Muir to Summit: 8 hours</li>
<li>From Summit back down to Muir: 5 hours</li>
<li>From Muir to the parking lot: 3 hours.</li>
</ul>


<p>So in total about 32 hours.</p>

<p>My favorite moments were waking up in the middle of night, gazing up at a
perfectly clear star-filled sky, and seeing St Helens silhouetted by the glow
of Portland.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed catching the first glow of the morning sky on the mountain and
watching it change the color of the landscape.</p>

<p>Finally I enjoyed butt sliding the rest of the way down the mountain and
arriving at a wild flower filled mountain fed stream that meant we would have
water to drink that didn&#8217;t involve melting snow.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of the pictures. The rest of my shots
and video from the trip can be found at on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/sets/72157627370662365/with/6070324037/">flickr set</a>.</p>

    <id>http://zadell.com/2011/getting-back-on-the-wagon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I accomplished a huge goal by <a href="http://zadell.com/2010/progress-update-%E2%80%93-30-pounds-down/">losing 30 lbs in about 3 months</a>.
Then I followed it up by losing an additional 5 pounds which brought me to my
lowest weight since high-school. I both felt and looked great and the change
was noticeable by everyone who knew me. After that I went into maintenance
mode and returned to enjoying good food. The problem is I have apparently been
enjoying myself a little too much and have crossed what I consider to be my
weight <em>limit</em>.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5276/5906418694_b04e8aa994_m.jpg"></p>

<p>Well it is time to get back on the wagon again. If my experience with weight
loss has taught me anything it is that weight loss is at least 80% diet, and I
know for a fact that I have been enjoying the good life when it comes to food
and beer a little bit too much.</p>

<p>During the past few months I haven&#8217;t exactly been inactive. I
<a href="http://zadell.com/2011/summiting-mount-hood/">climbed a mountain</a>,
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5906528522/">ran a bunch</a>, and have been
playing more tennis. I feel stronger and healthier than ever so why I am I
freaking out? Because it all begins some where. Sure a 5-10 pounds of weight
gain isn&#8217;t much but that is just the beginning. If I get comfortable with a
pound here and there then before I know it I will be overweight, out of shape and
hating myself.</p>

<p>I have set a new goal for myself to lose 10 pounds. It isn&#8217;t nearly as much as
last time but weight isn&#8217;t everything. This isn&#8217;t about maintenance any longer
but instead prevention.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be recording my progress using <a href="http://www.loseit.com/">loseit.com</a> and
the related iphone app. If anyone wants to join along then feel free to friend
me. My plan is to rein in control of my diet. I don&#8217;t think I can give up
eating good food completely (I don&#8217;t hate myself that much). What I do need to
do is to eat smaller portions. So instead of 20 delicious wings of King&#8217;s
Wings I will instead order ~6.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5116/5905875503_cefd7d5243_m.jpg"></p>

<p>The last time I dieted my most recorded food was ice cream. The key for me then was
instead of eating the entire pint I would only eat a single serving at a time
(~200 calories).</p>

<p>For me the most effective way to lose weight is to be accountable and
conscious of what I am doing. This is why I love using loseit because if you
are being honest with yourself then you can see exactly what you are doing. If
you are consistently over budget then of course the weight isn&#8217;t going to come
off. At the same time you are sharing your progress (or lack of) with your
friends who can then share in your success when you do reach your goals.</p>

<p>Bring on the six-pack abs please.</p>

<p>This is a panorama made up of about 11 overlapping shots. I took it as I was making my
way down from the summit. It wasn&#8217;t until I was making the journey down that I
really had an appreciation for just how beastly a journey it had been (8 hours
to the top for me).</p>

<p>One of the things I like about this shot is that you can see tiny specs that
are other hikers making the same journey that I had made.</p>

<p>Whenever I cross the Morrison bridge on a clear day in Portland one particular
object seems to stand out on the horizon - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood">Mount Hood</a>.
Hood is the highest mountain in Oregon at 11,249 ft yet around 10,000 people a year climb it. Now every
time that I see it I can say I am one of them.</p>

<p>This past Thursday a good friend of mine invited me to climb it and I quickly
agreed to it. The exact conversation went like this:</p>

<p><strong>Craig</strong>: want to climb a mountain?</p>

<p><strong>me</strong>: yes</p>

<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Hood?</p>

<p><strong>me</strong>: yep</p>

<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Have time Friday night/Saturday morning?</p>

<p><strong>me</strong>: yep</p>

<p>The next day I made my way to the local REI to rent and purchase some gear (an
Ice Axe, Helmet and Head Lamp) and that night found myself in the Timberline
parking lot freezing my ass off. Joining us on the hike were two others - Jon
and Tom. Everyone but myself had climbed Hood at least once before, with Tom
having climbed it three times previously.</p>

<p>The first words Tom spoke after parking the car and feeling the wind and
coldness - &#8220;OK let&#8217;s go back now.&#8221; Maybe it was the excitement or maybe it was
because of the month I had spent working in Copenhagen during the winter, but
the cold wasn&#8217;t affecting me at all. I actually stripped down to my underwear
and changed in the middle of the parking lot while everyone else huddled in
the car.</p>

<div class='image' id='5800822641'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5800822641/><img class='center' src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2087/5800822641_29c6542bff_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>The Start of the Hike at Timberline</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<p>We started the climb at 1:40am. Climbers try to Summit before the sun fully
rises as the final part of the hike can get dangerous when the snow begins to
melt and freeze. So by doing it early you attempt to avoid that danger.</p>

<p>The day before the hike I mentally prepared myself for it. A few years ago I
climbed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/sets/72157606145105082/">South Sisters</a>
so I had some experience with climbing. Namely that no matter what shape that I was
in physically there would come a time where I would be looking at my feet
focusing on each individual step and would have to will myself to continue on.
This happened quite often during the hike.</p>

<div class='image' id='5800830697'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5800830697/><img class='center' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3267/5800830697_87ba4236a4_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Enjoying the First Light</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>

<p>Despite the strong winds we managed to completely avoid losing any gear. At
least 3 times we had a piece of equipment fly off down the mountain only to be
chased down and retrieved by Craig.</p>

<div class='image' id='5801399002'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801399002/><img class='center' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5067/5801399002_92de94a5fd_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Enjoying the Mountain Light</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>

<p>One of my favorite parts of the hike was when the sun was still rising on the
other side of the mountain. This would cause the snow to melt and blow over
the peak. The sun would catch on the snow and light it up.</p>

<div class='image' id='5801407450'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5801407450/><img class='center' src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3556/5801407450_d0e713bf9b_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Mount Hood Panorama</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>

<p>We kept a pretty slow pace. The softness of the snow ment that if your footing
wasn&#8217;t sure then you would be sliding back down. Repeating that over thousands
of steps is very exhausting. So we weren&#8217;t surprised to see lots of teams pass
us on the way up and then back down again.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the hike was dealing with the strong and cold winds. Often
I would have to stop and kneel during the hike until the wind died down.</p>

<p>When we got past Crater Rock and on to the the Hogsback we learned that many teams were turning back and not
completing the summit due to the weather conditions. By the time we were there
though the weather had cleared up enough that it wasn&#8217;t completely insane to
make the final traversal from the Pearly Gates to the Summit.</p>

<p>The climb up to the Pearly Gates was one of the more difficult parts of the
hike. To accomplish this climb we needed to equip our grampons, helmets and
use our ice axes. Equipping my grampons was particularly challenging due to
the extreme snow flurries that would blow past us on the Hogsback. More than
once I had to pause and heat my hands back from numbness.</p>

<p>Using the ice axe and grampons was a whole new challenge for myself. It was a
slow process of planting the axe handle into the ice and using it belay
yourself while you kick your feet into solid footing. The entire time there is
the risk that you will slip and slide down uncontrollably into a crevice at
the bottom.</p>

<p>The trip back down was actually the hardest part of the hike. Coming up we
couldn&#8217;t actually see how far we had to go or how high we had to climb because
of the darkness. Going down was just the opposite and the parking lot never
seemed to ever get closer while my body began to hurt more and more.</p>

<p>After all of it though I can now look on Hood and say to myself that I had
conquered it. Which is a pretty good feeling. It was a hard hike but I
honestly enjoyed every bit of it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='image' id='5565645881'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5565645881/><img class='center' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5565645881_56829923dd_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>london bridge pano</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<p>If you haven&#8217;t noticed - <a href="http://zaczadell.com/tag/panoramas/">I love panoramas.</a> I think they do a fantastic
job of capturing the feel of a location much better than any single picture
could and they aren&#8217;t all that difficult to produce. Here is a quick tutorial
on the methods that I use to take awesome travel panoramas.</p>

<p>I generally rely on two primary methods for taking them - either with my big
dslr and photoshop or my iphone and a stitching app.</p>

<h3>DSLR, Photoshop and Optionally a Tripod</h3>

<p>This is the more established method that I use when I want something that I
intend to either print out or blow up later. The method requires that I take
several pictures that slightly overlap with a wide angle lens. If I can I will
use my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015MFTE4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ftp0e-%0A20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0015MFTE4">tripod</a> that has a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UOCWUK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ftp0e-2%0A0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002UOCWUK">panning head</a> on it, which
allows me to take sharp shots with precise overlap.</p>

<p>When a tripod isn&#8217;t available though I simply snap a bunch of pictures and
manually pan from left to right (or vica verca) across the scene.</p>

<p>Once you get the hang of it, the process takes only slightly longer than
taking a single shot. I tend to take 3-5 shots for every panorama.</p>

<p>The next step is to use photoshop&#8217;s <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/P%0Ahotoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-75e8a.html">photomerge</a> feature. You
give it a list of pictures and it will try and blend them together in a
meaningful way - usually a panorama.</p>

<h3>Iphone + autostitch app</h3>

<p>I can&#8217;t always have my camera + tripod with me but I will most likely have my
phone. For the cost of a cheap app (under $3 and totally worth every penny), I
can grab panoramas wherever I go. I use
<a href="http://www.cloudburstresearch.com/autostitch/autostitch.html">autostitch</a>.</p>

<p>This method won&#8217;t yield the sharpest results but it will definitely be better
than nothing. The iphone&#8217;s lens isn&#8217;t very wide, so be sure to capture shots
both above and below the shots that make up your panorama. This will allow you
to take in some of the sky and ground. So instead of 3 shots you will end up
taking around 9. Autostich is a champ at combining everything together.</p>

<div class='image' id='5566228732'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5566228732/><img class='center' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5566228732_2d085237bb_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Saint Peters Cathedral</span></h2><p class='description'><em>3 photo vertical panorama (vertorama)
</em></p></div>




<div class='image' id='5565642185'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5565642185/><img class='center' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5225/5565642185_9bc61d33e7_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>london eye</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<p>You can also use the same method to take
vertical shots aka vertoramas. This picture of Saint Peters Cathedral is made
up of 3 images taken while panning vertically. Despite having a very wide
angle lens (10mm) there is no other way I could have captured the entire
building from that position without using this method.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and let me know if you want me to go into any greater
detail into what exactly is involved. Otherwise this should be enough to get
you started in taking awesome travel panoramas yourself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='image' id='5564207887'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5564207887/><img class='center' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/5564207887_549fde6b4d_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Eiffel Tower Before the Storm</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<p>The weather in Paris didn&#8217;t quite work out for me. I had planned on spending
the evening photographing the city at night only to find myself in a race to
stay dry while still getting <em>some</em> shots of the iconic tower. I had gone on a
3 hour tour the city after exploring the Louvre and was exhausted at this
point. I only had enough time to grab a few shots and ask some friendly
tourists to grab some shots of myself before the sky opened up and drenched
everyone.</p>

<div class='image' id='5564797602'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5564797602/><img class='center' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5011/5564797602_801c2c9aee_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Keeping Dry in the Metro</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<p>Oddly enough I met a ton of awesome Spanish people on this trip. I stayed in a
cheap hostel that had mixed dorms and ended up rooming with college-aged
Spanish girls. On the tour I ended up also meeting a bunch of guys from
Barcelona and Madrid. Their friendliness definitely convinced me to add Spain
to my future travels.</p>

<div class='image' id='5564790182'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5564790182/><img class='center' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5183/5564790182_4237505e55_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Nyarr and the Eiffel Tower</span></h2><p class='description'><em></em></p></div>


<p>One of my goals for this trip was to travel as light as possible (while still
carrying my camera + lenses). I ended up not bringing my laptop or tripod and
wearing exclusively my vibram five fingers. The other tourists really got a
kick out of my vffs.</p>

<p>During one point in the trip I was sprinting between metros trying to make it
to my flight on time. A friendly French dude ended up leading me Parkour-style
over the ticket stalls and showing me how to avoid getting caught in the
process. Overall the French that I encountered left a really good impression
on me.</p>

<p>This picture represents a special memory for me. Not only was it an absolute
perfect night for photography but I also had a chance to take a picture of the
rare occurance of a <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/">super moon</a>.</p>

<p>This is one of the final pictures I took after a day of touring London. By
this point my entire body was complaining and I still had an hour long walk
ahead of me back to my hostel. Despite the pain I was incredibly happy to be
doing what I was where I was doing it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I leave on a cheap flight to spend the weekend in Paris - another
first for me. Thanks for viewing!</p>

<p>I woke up Saturday morning in a London hostel and then proceeded to spend the
next 10 hours touring the city - mostly on foot. The entire time I lugged
around my tripod wondering if I should have left the thing at home.</p>

<p>Then the sun set and I was treated to London at night in the form of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square">Trafalagar Square</a> making my
sore shoulders and feet worth it.</p>

<p>I am spending a month working in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The weather here isn&#8217;t exactly pleasant. The strange combination of cold,
wind, rain and snow means I am not spending much time outdoors. On my walks to
and from work I am bundled up and am amazed to see people going for jogs or
riding their bikes without their face or heads covered while it is raining and
freezing.</p>

<p>My time here has actually been healthier than usual despite being in a foreign
country. I chalk this up to two factors: 1) My apartment/hotel has a clean
pool and decent weight room 2) the food here is pretty lackluster. Combine
those traits with the craptastic weather and I have yet to really leave my
apartment except to go to work.</p>

<p>I feel zero desire to eat out because everything is bland and over priced and
I am working out and swimming every day. Food wise I have been following a
slow-carb diet which does away with carbs like sugars, pastas and breads. So
it is mostly vegetables and proteins. My most common meal has been eggs, beans
and some frozen vegetables. Yummy.</p>

<p>At the office we get catered lunches. Everyone always complains about the
quality but it is a perk that I definitely appreciate and don&#8217;t get to take
advantage of because I work remotely. There is just enough variety that I
don&#8217;t have to deviate from my diet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5514732854/"><img class="right" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5140/5514732854_4ce4d6fee6_d.jpg"></a></p>

<p>I plan to spend my first weekend here decompressing from a busy but productive
week of work by mostly reading on my kindle. The weather is going to be decent
- at least rain and snow isn&#8217;t on the forecast. I hope to be able to get out
and grab some more pictures or chill in a cafe some place.</p>

<p>The upcoming weekends should be more interesting though. So far I have booked
weekend trips to London and Paris. It will be my first time traveling to
either place. Both flights have me leaving Friday after work and returning
Sunday night. Once you are in Europe it is pretty remarkable where you can
travel to for 100-200 bucks.</p>
