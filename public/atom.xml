<p>Our hostel was within a mile of a beautiful and popular temple called Sensoji.</p>

<p>The path leading up to the temple was lined with shops selling
traditional treats and merchandise. During our first night we caught the
very first glimpse of blooming Sakura.</p>

<p>After finally arriving in Tokyo we set out to accomplish one of my
goals for the trip - to experience true Japanese Ramen.</p>

<p>Our hostel is based in the Asakusa district of Tokyo which is known for
it&#8217;s famous temple - Sensoji. We set out to explore the area and
stumbled upon an empty shop. I didn&#8217;t expect much from it given it was
the first place that we encountered but thankfully I walked away after
having one of best ramen experiences of my life.</p>

<p>The shop itself was made up of only a few chairs and the two chefs. One
made the ramen while the other made the gyoza.</p>

<p>Ddeokbokki is one of the first Korean dishes that Seyoung taught me.
Whenever she is sick and needs something spicy and comforting I make it
for her. It is simply made up of rice cakes, fish cakes, vegetables and
a chilli paste based sauce.</p>

<p>Before coming to Korea I had no idea just how common a dish it
is. Just about everywhere we went it could be found on street corners
sold by vendors. It is also pretty cheap - a typical meal costs about
$3 and was enough to feed two. At the end of a busy day of sight seeing we would find a random street vendor who would serve it with a warm cup of broth and eat it with tooth picks.</p>

<p>Daegu is the birthplace of my fiance (who took the above picture). When I first met her 6 years ago
we didn&#8217;t think we would ever have the opportunity to visit her hometown.</p>

<p>Over the years I built up an expectation for Daegu. To listen to people describe it - Daegu is a back
country town filled with uninteresting people and little to do. My
experience was pretty far from this. Maybe it is because Seoul is a
gigantic, crowded and bustling city and in comparison to that just about any other city in the
world is small. Daegu though for me was a wonderful change of pace.
Everyone we encountered was warm, welcoming and helpful. Growing up in
Hawaii and living in Portland I am perhaps more accustomed to a slower
pace to life than what Seoul offered. Daegu felt way more livable.</p>

<p>I visited Palgongsan while visiting family in Daegu South Korea in March during my 3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>This was yet another example of a landscape dominated by the haze from
pollution from China. To get here you take a beautiful ride up in a
cable car that seems designed to appeal to young lovers.</p>

<p>I visited Seoraksan (a mountain in South Korea) in March during my
3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>South Korea for me was dominated by pollution and smog that drifted from the
neighboring China, as a result this picture has a fogginess to it. What
isn&#8217;t captured is just how windy it was there - I at several points
nearly lost my glasses.</p>

<p>Seoraksan is the sort of place that I will most certainly have to visit
again at some point in my life. Picture monk filled temples over-looking
crystal clear mountain streams in the mountains and you get an idea of
how awesome and peaceful a place it is.</p>

<p>After briefly attempting to surf 5 years ago I wanted to make sure I learned how to
do it right and ended up finding <a

had me up and surfing on the very first wave and probably inspired a

<p>Out of the few sunsets that I have taken here on Oahu my one regret so far was that I
had not grabbed a truely pink one yet. The weather conditions have been
a little too nice here which has lead to a relatively clear sky, which
in photography terms is boring.</p>

<p>We spent the day touring the South East side of the island like tourists
without the intention of grabbing a sunset. This included a trip to
Moana Falls and Waikiki. Just before deciding to head home for the day I caught
a glimpse of the beach and decided to check it out. I hadn&#8217;t expected
much but after a few minutes the light changed drastically and the sky
turned pink.</p>

<p>Portlock Beach is surrounded by million dollar homes. Thankfully the
beaches are still public property and there are public access to all of
them. When I was taking this picture there was a small group of locals
taking advantage of the public access to fish and enjoy the sunset as
well. I couldn&#8217;t help but appreciate how very fortunate they are to be able to enjoy a million dollar
view and fish every day.</p>

<p>This is a 102 second exposure done using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012LO1UG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ftp0e-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B0012LO1UG&adid=0SRAV7KBSA7DQ2K3VZ49&">Neutral Density 1000x filter</a>. The filter
acts to block out the light requiring the picture to take 10 times as
long to properly expose. During that amount of time the water and light
change and over time evens out leaving the glassy look that you see.</p>

<p>Today marks one week on the island and on vacation.</p>

<p>I had wanted to get out every night to grab a sunset while here but
family obligations began to take its tole on me and required that I take
some evenings off to get some rest.</p>

<p>Today we rented a car and decided to tour the island. We began with a
trip across the island to Lanakai Beach - which many consider one of the
best beaches in the world. I was able to swim to one of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7007734326">Mokulua Islands</a> and
enjoy the bird sanctuary there before swimming back.</p>

<p>Despite being here for a week I had yet to have some Ramen. Thankfully we stumbled upon <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7154502656">Rai Rai Ramen</a> in Kailua which was superb. Then we made our way to the Valley of the Temples to visit the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7156944902">Byodo-In Temple</a>.</p>

<p>We continued north to grab a quick shave ice from Aoki&#8217;s in Haleiwa then
finally made our way to Kaena Point on the west side of the island to
grab this sunset.</p>

<p>Spring is starting to peak it&#8217;s head out from the rain and the snow here in Oregon. I
thought I would take advantage of the opportunity and spend the weekend at the coast
shooting Haystack Rock at Cannon Beach.</p>

<p>The weekend promised clear skies and warm weather (for the Oregon Coast at least). Unfortunately I was cheated out of a glorious sunset and instead had to settle for this.</p>

<p>Despite my inactivity for posting pictures over the last 6 months - photography has still been on
my mind. The new year has brought about a ton of postive changes and I
am as excited as ever.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for many more pictures to come in 2012.</p>

<h2>You In?</h2>

<p>About 10 days ago I got an email from one of the friends I climbed Hood with
asking if I wanted to climb Rainier. It contained a short description of the
hike and ended with &#8220;It will be a miserable and wonderful experience. You in?&#8221;</p>

<p>He honestly didn&#8217;t even need to ask. Even after it was all over and I could
barely stand, when simple things like opening a beer would cause me to cramp
up, did I feel the same way as I did then - of course I was in.</p>

<p>I think I have reached a stage in my life where simply because something is
difficult is not reason enough not to do it. When I look back at the past year
one of the things I think of most fondly is my Summit of Hood back in June.
Whenever I am about Portland and I catch a glimpse of Hood I can&#8217;t help but
feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment knowing that I conquered such a
gigantic mountain.</p>

<p>What better gift to myself than to be able to claim that I conquered another
mountain?</p>

<div class='image' id='6070864990'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/6070864990/><img class='center' src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6070864990_fe656c11ce_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Little Tahoma and the Glacier</span></h2></div>


<h2>What&#8217;s Involved</h2>

<p>The Rainier summit is at 14,411 ft compared to Hood&#8217;s 11,249 ft. In several of
my shots there is a mountain called Little Tahoma that seems tiny when on the
mountain. It is actually only 100 ft smaller than Mount Hood.</p>

<p>This climb up Rainier is much longer than Hood was. The very last part of
Hood, where you need an ice axe to self bellet yourself is probably more
technically challenging than anything I encountered on Rainier, but beyond
that Rainier is in a different league of difficulty because of the endurance
you will need.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that someone went from the parking lot to the top of the mountain
and back in 5 hours. We would be traveling with a 90 liter pack filled with
gear, food and clothing, which would mean we would be traveling much slower
than he did.</p>

<div class='image' id='6070277665'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/6070277665/><img class='center' src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6070277665_f10288fa08_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Rainier Sunrise</span></h2></div>


<p>Weight was always on my mind. None of my gear is particularly light. My pack
is about 15 years old and no where near being ideal for climbing mountains
with. I elected to leave my relatively heavy Nikon D90 + Sigma 10-20 combo that I
adored on Hood home in exchange for a much lighter (if damaged) Canon G9. My
G9 has been through quite a bit so it is filled with dust and if I ever tried
to change its focal length it would lock up and give a lens error. I really
wish I could have spared the weight but realize that many of the shots that I
did get would not have happened if I had to fumble through my pack constantly
to retrive my camera.</p>

<p>The hike involves leaving early in the morning from the
Paradise parking lot with all your gear. From there you will travel roughly 4
hours to Camp Muir. The trip up was relatively easy. I was fresh and my pack
felt light. Despite the length of the hike most of the people doing it were
approaching it as a day hike - so up to Camp Muir and back.</p>

<p>Like many others though we were in it to go all the way. We arrived at Muir
shortly after noon and then spent the next 12 hours sleeping, filtering water
and cooking. We were really concerned about having to carry a tent so we
sprinted to Muir to make sure that we had a spot in the first come first serve
hut that is available to climbers for free.</p>

<div class='image' id='6070260203'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/6070260203/><img class='center' src='http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6070260203_c0f96e8dee_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>Camp Muir Sunset</span></h2></div>


<p>We were able to get good spots and shortly after the place filled up with people who would be
waking up the same time as we did to tackle the mountain. It seems everyone
had the same plan and woke up around midnight to eat some breakfast, gear up
and head out for what would be much more difficult climb than the first half of
the mountain.</p>

<p>By the end of the climb I was so exhausted that I had to break frequently to
make the short walk to the actual summit. Without realizing it I was nearly on
the verge of tears as we celebrated the climb. Was it the hardest thing I had
ever done? Maybe. Most exhausting? Definitely.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the experience was realizing you had to climb
all the way back down again though. Shale and sliding snow made for a really
uncomfortable trip down.</p>

<h2>How long does it take?</h2>

<p>Total trip broke down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hike to Camp Muir: 4 hours</li>
<li>Resting at Camp Muir then waking up at midnight: 12 hours</li>
<li>Hiking from Muir to Summit: 8 hours</li>
<li>From Summit back down to Muir: 5 hours</li>
<li>From Muir to the parking lot: 3 hours.</li>
</ul>


<p>So in total about 32 hours.</p>

<p>My favorite moments were waking up in the middle of night, gazing up at a
perfectly clear star-filled sky, and seeing St Helens silhouetted by the glow
of Portland.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed catching the first glow of the morning sky on the mountain and
watching it change the color of the landscape.</p>

<p>Finally I enjoyed butt sliding the rest of the way down the mountain and
arriving at a wild flower filled mountain fed stream that meant we would have
water to drink that didn&#8217;t involve melting snow.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of the pictures. The rest of my shots
