<p>I spend every day at work making web apps so when it came down to making
a site for my upcoming wedding I wanted something simple. I decided to forego using any frameworks
or even using a database and instead make a single page - static site. Check it
out at <a href="http://zacharyandseyoung.com">zacharyandseyoung.com</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of the design was convey all the information that our guests
would need - date, place, directions etc. Additionally though I wanted to make
sure that once guests traveled here they would have a great list of
things to do that didn&#8217;t involve the wedding and which would hopefully
give them an appreciation for the city that we love and call home.</p>

<p>I also wanted something that would look good on either a PC, tablet or
phone.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8127/8712678306_84f3810b3d_b.jpg"></p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The site itself is just html/css/js using bootstrap for its basic grid system
and mobile friendly responsiveness with some custom styling.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses some additional js that wasn&#8217;t included in stock bootstrap like fitvid.js for video
resizing and sticky.js for the navigation but over all I was able to accomplish what I wanted
much faster than without it.</p></li>
<li><p>The RSVP form is just a simple wufoo form that emails us when someone
registers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The view from Tokyo Tower observatory.</p>

<p>Tripods were not allowed up here so I got these shots by creatively
propping up my camera against the glass of the windows. I used my coat
to block out reflections.</p>

<p>I really appreciated the blade-runner like view and reflections of the
traffic in the building windows.</p>

<p>Our hostel was within a mile of a beautiful and popular temple called Sensoji.</p>

<p>The path leading up to the temple was lined with shops selling
traditional treats and merchandise. During our first night we caught the
very first glimpse of blooming Sakura.</p>

<p>After finally arriving in Tokyo we set out to accomplish one of my
goals for the trip - to experience true Japanese Ramen.</p>

<p>Our hostel is based in the Asakusa district of Tokyo which is known for
it&#8217;s famous temple - Sensoji. We set out to explore the area and
stumbled upon an empty shop. I didn&#8217;t expect much from it given it was
the first place that we encountered but thankfully I walked away after
having one of best ramen experiences of my life.</p>

<p>The shop itself was made up of only a few chairs and the two chefs. One
made the ramen while the other made the gyoza.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of the game Starcraft - both playing it and watching pros
compete at it. The game has become a global phenominon since the
original was released in 1998.</p>

<p>To get an idea of what it is like at the highest levels - picture the strategy of chess with the adrenaline producing rush of a wrestling match. No place appreciates the game more than South Korea - home of the best players in the world.</p>

<div class='image' id='8556598294'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/8556598294/><img class='center' src='http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8100/8556598294_d6bf881bdc_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>The Crowd</span></h2></div>


<p>On March 12th Blizzard would be releasing the newest expansion to Starcraft 2.
To celebrate the Blizzard held a global launch event that began in Seoul and traversed the timezones for the next 24 hours. They gathered the top pros from Starcraft and Starcraft 2 and put them on stage to demonstrate the potential of the new expansion.</p>

<div class='image' id='8555469249'><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/8555469249/><img class='center' src='http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8104/8555469249_a38fea4aba_b.jpg'></a><h2><span>The Pros</span></h2></div>


<p>These players have been given nicknames by their fans such as God and
the Tyrant. They have legions of fan girls and are paid hundreds of
thousands of dollars each year by the largest companies in South Korea
all to compete at the highest level.</p>

<p>It was an amazing opportunity to be at the Mecca of Starcraft and be
able to witness the birth of a new era for the game. After waiting in line with hundreds of other fans I was able to pick up one of the very first copies of the collector&#8217;s edition sold in the world.</p>

<p>Ddeokbokki is one of the first Korean dishes that Seyoung taught me.
Whenever she is sick and needs something spicy and comforting I make it
for her. It is simply made up of rice cakes, fish cakes, vegetables and
a chilli paste based sauce.</p>

<p>Before coming to Korea I had no idea just how common a dish it
is. Just about everywhere we went it could be found on street corners
sold by vendors. It is also pretty cheap - a typical meal costs about
$3 and was enough to feed two. At the end of a busy day of sight seeing we would find a random street vendor who would serve it with a warm cup of broth and eat it with tooth picks.</p>

<p>Daegu is the birthplace of my fiance (who took the above picture). When I first met her 6 years ago
we didn&#8217;t think we would ever have the opportunity to visit her hometown.</p>

<p>Over the years I built up an expectation for Daegu. To listen to people describe it - Daegu is a back
country town filled with uninteresting people and little to do. My
experience was pretty far from this. Maybe it is because Seoul is a
gigantic, crowded and bustling city and in comparison to that just about any other city in the
world is small. Daegu though for me was a wonderful change of pace.
Everyone we encountered was warm, welcoming and helpful. Growing up in
Hawaii and living in Portland I am perhaps more accustomed to a slower
pace to life than what Seoul offered. Daegu felt way more livable.</p>

<p>I visited Palgongsan while visiting family in Daegu South Korea in March during my 3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>This was yet another example of a landscape dominated by the haze from
pollution from China. To get here you take a beautiful ride up in a
cable car that seems designed to appeal to young lovers.</p>

<p>I visited Seoraksan (a mountain in South Korea) in March during my
3 week trip to South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>South Korea for me was dominated by pollution and smog that drifted from the
neighboring China, as a result this picture has a fogginess to it. What
isn&#8217;t captured is just how windy it was there - I at several points
nearly lost my glasses.</p>

<p>Seoraksan is the sort of place that I will most certainly have to visit
again at some point in my life. Picture monk filled temples over-looking
crystal clear mountain streams in the mountains and you get an idea of
how awesome and peaceful a place it is.</p>

do it right and ended up finding <a

had me up and surfing on the very first wave and probably inspired a
life long love of the sport.</p>

<p>Out of the few sunsets that I have taken here on Oahu my one regret so far was that I
had not grabbed a truely pink one yet. The weather conditions have been
a little too nice here which has lead to a relatively clear sky, which
in photography terms is boring.</p>

<p>We spent the day touring the South East side of the island like tourists
without the intention of grabbing a sunset. This included a trip to
Moana Falls and Waikiki. Just before deciding to head home for the day I caught
a glimpse of the beach and decided to check it out. I hadn&#8217;t expected
much but after a few minutes the light changed drastically and the sky
turned pink.</p>

<p>Portlock Beach is surrounded by million dollar homes. Thankfully the
beaches are still public property and there are public access to all of
them. When I was taking this picture there was a small group of locals
taking advantage of the public access to fish and enjoy the sunset as
well. I couldn&#8217;t help but appreciate how very fortunate they are to be able to enjoy a million dollar
view and fish every day.</p>

<p>This is a 102 second exposure done using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012LO1UG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ftp0e-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B0012LO1UG&adid=0SRAV7KBSA7DQ2K3VZ49&">Neutral Density 1000x filter</a>. The filter
acts to block out the light requiring the picture to take 10 times as
long to properly expose. During that amount of time the water and light
change and over time evens out leaving the glassy look that you see.</p>

<p>Today marks one week on the island and on vacation.</p>

<p>I had wanted to get out every night to grab a sunset while here but
family obligations began to take its tole on me and required that I take
some evenings off to get some rest.</p>

<p>Today we rented a car and decided to tour the island. We began with a
trip across the island to Lanakai Beach - which many consider one of the
best beaches in the world. I was able to swim to one of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7007734326">Mokulua Islands</a> and
enjoy the bird sanctuary there before swimming back.</p>

<p>Despite being here for a week I had yet to have some Ramen. Thankfully we stumbled upon <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7154502656">Rai Rai Ramen</a> in Kailua which was superb. Then we made our way to the Valley of the Temples to visit the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/7156944902">Byodo-In Temple</a>.</p>

<p>We continued north to grab a quick shave ice from Aoki&#8217;s in Haleiwa then
finally made our way to Kaena Point on the west side of the island to
grab this sunset.</p>
