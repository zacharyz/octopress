  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314864412/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5314864412_b8f2048f%0Ad4_z.jpg" alt="View at Mount Hood" /></a></p>

<p>I have been living in Portland for just about a year now. One of the big draws
of Portland was how close it was to Mount Hood and we envisioned heading to
this place every weekend. In reality we didn&#8217;t even go once the entire year. I
wanted to start the year off differently though and celebrate it with a snow
boarding trip. Despite the cost and the fear of it being extremely crowded
given the fresh snow and weekend it turned out to be fantastic.</p>

<p>All the pictures taken for this post were made with my iphone. While I would
have loved to have used my DSLR there, some times the best camera is the one
you have with you. I use an app called AutoStitch which creates a panorama
from a bunch of pictures. Most of the panoramas that I take use anywhere from
three to nine pictures.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I learned how to board together a few years ago. We go very
sporadicly, so every time it feels like we have to learn the basics over
again. By the time we are finish we feel like we know what we are doing but
then the process repeats itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314866632/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5201/5314866632_b7853a783%0A5_z.jpg" alt="Snow Boarding Pro" /></a></p>

<p>We don&#8217;t own a 4wd vehicle so we used a bus service to get to Mount Hood. This
involves parking our car some place, then sleeping on the bus for 2 hours
while the driver deals with parking and the snow. Once there we rented the
boards and boots.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5314268817/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5314268817_1c2fcae95b_z.jpg" alt="Tough Spot" /></a></p>

<p>On my very first run my worst fear happened: I had no idea how to interpret
the route signs and some how stumbled upon a run that was way above my level.
I quickly lost momentum and found myself surrounded by trees in fresh, deep
snow. When I tried to move myself I would sink into the snow. The weather was
absolutely perfect though and I didn&#8217;t really care. At one point I found
myself at the top of a very steep hill that looked very dangerous. I butt slid
around and eventually realized that I was surrounded by similar tracks.
Apparently I wasn&#8217;t the only person to recently be in the same situation.
Eventually I pushed and hiked my way through the snow until I got to a clear
hill and was on my way again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5318278146/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5318278146_155bae42da_%0Az.jpg" alt="Cascade Express" /></a></p>

<p>After spending some time around the newbie coarse I eventually became more
comfortable riding the snow board and decided to make my way up the mountain.
After taking the above picture I was entranced by the beauty of the mountain,
only to realize shortly afterwards that I was no longer holding my glove. I
glanced over my shoulder just as it hit the snow. I spent the rest of the trip
trying to memorize a route to my glove and planning how the heck I would get
down there without my glove. I opted to use my inner fleece as a glove (which
worked horribly) and had to make frequent stops to warm my hand. Shortly
before reaching it though another boarder had picked it up and deposited it at
the entrance. Thanks man!</p>

<p>Despite worrying about my glove I couldn&#8217;t help but snap the above panorama at
Cascade Express.</p>

<p>Throughout the day I couldn&#8217;t help but appreciate just how lucky I was to be
where I was - perfect weather and snow, tearing down a beautiful mountain. It
was an amazing way to celebrate the end of an awesome year and the beginning
of a new one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://30at30.zadell.com/wordpress/wp-%0Acontent/uploads/2010/12/30pounds.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5163/5247320766_bb6be9ff9e.jpg" alt="159.8" /></p>

<p>I was actually confused this morning when I looked at my scale. I was
expecting to see 161 or 162 and hadn&#8217;t expected to lose that last pound for
another few days. Coming back from my last trip where I was consistently
hovering just barely over 170 - loseit kept predicting my completion date as
getting ever closer to the end of the year. This made me think more and more
than it was unreasonable to lose 30 pounds in the time frame I wanted.</p>

<p>This past week I have had only one thing in mind with regards to my diet - eat
whatever I wanted to as long as I was under budget. The last few pictures that
I have posted have been of <a href="http://zadell.com/2010/12/06%0A/breakfast-at-broder/">Swedish Hash</a>, <a href="http://zadell.com/2010/12/06%0A/breakfast-at-broder/">Danish Pancakes</a>, <a href="http://zadell.com/2010/12/06/pho-dalat/">Pho</a> and a
<a href="http://zadell.com/2010/12/08/rocking-frog-cafe/">Panini</a>. Loseit lists ice-
cream as one of my favorite foods. This shows me that a large part of losing
weight is really about managing <em>how much</em> you eat.</p>

<p>For the first few months I ran and exercised like a mad man, which made me
feel great. Then when I was injured I didn&#8217;t have the luxury of knowing that I
would be able to eat those 400-600 more calories thanks to my run. Loading up
on calories can be incredibly easy - a bag of chips, some ice-cream, eating
out. Bam - you just consumed more calories than your body can burn. So the
important thing for me was learning to manage my portions and how much I ate.</p>

<p>Now comes another challenge - not putting it all back on again.</p>

<p>My ankle is beginning to feel good enough to run on again and I am starting to
do more body weight exercises. I no doubt lost <em>some</em> muscle over the last
year and half where I didn&#8217;t lift consistently so a part of me wants to try
and put that back on.</p>

<p>For now though I am thrilled to be going into the New Year knowing that I was
able to actually accomplish a weight loss goal.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>3,175 calories</strong> under budget for the week. Lost <strong>1.8 pounds</strong> this week.<br/>
Still making progress - if not much. I feel like I am about 2 weeks tops from
reaching my goal for the year. I got as low as 162.3 this week, but for the
most part stayed around 163 throughout the week. With the end in sight I am
definitely appreciating just how much my body has changed in only ~27 pounds.
Even though I wasn&#8217;t thrilled with how I looked at 190 I still felt that I was
better off than the majority of the population. People are really starting to
take notice though which feels awesome.</p>

<p>I am at the point where I can&#8217;t imagine not using loseit to track my diet. I
don&#8217;t want to go back to just eating whatever is put in front of me without
thinking about the consequences. That is what got me 30 pounds heavier in the
first place. I feel that with my current diet I am not getting enough food,
but because I am sidelined and not doing anything that requires mobility I
haven&#8217;t needed to eat more than I am.</p>

<p>My ankle <em>still</em> feels jacked. I tried running on it earlier in the week and
didn&#8217;t get more than a few blocks before I was back to hobbling. It is really
frustrating to get so into running only to be sidelined like this for as long
as I have been. Thankfully I am no longer suffering from that cold that I
suffered through for the past couple of weeks.</p>
