<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>4,147</strong> calories under budget for the week. Lost <strong>2 pounds</strong> this week.</p>

<p>Half way to my goal, with pretty consistent weight loss so far. I got as low
at 173 after a run but felt horrible because I hadn&#8217;t eaten enough so I spent
the rest of the week refueling.</p>

<p>I hope to be under 170 2 weeks from now.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p><strong>2,270 calories</strong> under budget for the week. Lost <strong>2 pounds</strong> this week.<br/>
This week was surprising in that I managed to lose weight despite exercising
less. During a run early in the week my left calf cramped up and popped, which
as you can imagine was quite alarming. That was enough to tell me to listen to
my body and to take it easy for the rest of the week. This week I don&#8217;t plan
on going running every day like I have been to give my body some time to
repair itself. I will be attending more jiu jitsu though and doing more kettle
bell training.</p>

<p>Almost half-way there!</p>

<p>Towards the end of our stay in Zurich Switzerland we decided that we wanted to
find a good view of the city. The local city information guide recommended
that be board a tram and take it up to the zoo.</p>

<p>It was already late in the day and the zoo was closed, so when we arrived
there was no one else around. For a moment I was worried that we would be
stranded. Around where we were there was no obvious view.</p>

<p>Eventually I struck up the courage to try and ask a local if he had any idea
where we might find the view that the guide had referred to. He didn&#8217;t speak a
bit of English but after a few silly gestures from myself - a huge smile
formed on a his face and he knew exactly what we were looking for.</p>

<p><a href="h%0Attp://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4866237215/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4866237215_777ed3e365_z.jpg" alt="Zurich" /></a></p>

<p>A short walk past a simply amazing field of sunflowers revealed a spectacular
view of the city. From there we could see the Alps in the distance as well as
the beautiful city in its entirety.</p>

<p>Zurich is a very expensive city to do anything in, but for the price of a tram
pass we were treated to a very special view that I feel few tourists are
treated to.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful city.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>3,488 calories under budget for the week.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lost 1 pound this week.</strong></p>

<p>Compared to the first three weeks this week has been relatively conservative
in terms of weight loss despite plenty of exercise and reasonable calorie
deficits. This week I decided to listen to my body and turn down the
intensity. One of my ankles were cranked in a submission during jiu jitsu
practice and my calves were feeling tight because of all the running I have
been doing in Vibram Five Fingers. So this weekend I actually didn&#8217;t do
anything that resembled exercise. I also was worried that I was becoming
dehydrated. I got as low as 176 after some of my workouts then rehydrated back
up to 179/180.</p>

<p>One side effect of my weight loss is that I have to run further to get the
same calorie burn on my runs. So I am going to slowly move towards running 4+
miles each run vs my usual 5k/3.11 miles. I also want to experiment with
running some HIITs, which are basically intervals of high and low intensity
during my runs vs a consistent pace throughout. My slow and steady running
style is enabling me to run further but I feel like my body is simply adapting
to the pace without getting faster.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>4,897 calories under budget for the week.</strong> <strong>Lost 3.6 pounds this week.</strong><br/>
This weeks gains have been in large part due to getting a pair of Vibram Five
Fingers which have contributed to my desire to run a lot more. I also played a
lot more tennis this past week than I usually do thanks to some decent
weather.</p>

<p>Getting down to 180 means I have hit my first milestone - I have lost 10
pounds!</p>

<p>In just over 3 weeks I have made it 1/3rd a way through my goal of losing 30
pounds and weighing 160. I woke up this morning after refueling with my cheat
day to weigh 180.</p>

<p>It hasn&#8217;t been easy - but it has been fun. During this past month I have
logged more miles running than ever before. According to Nike+ I have logged
about 20 miles in the past week alone and lowered my 5k time below 30 minutes.
Not bad for someone who only recently completed the Couch to 5k program about
10 days ago.</p>

<p>For the next 10 pounds I plan to incorporate more weight training with kettle
bells as well as some jiu jitsu training. This past month has been all cardio
and I fear that I might plateau if I don&#8217;t mix it up.</p>

<p>When I was in high-school I used to run on the cross-country team. It was a
way for me to train in the off seasons between baseball and wrestling.
Eventually I actually became decent recording my fastest 5k time at around 19
minutes, which translates to about a 6 minute mile pace.</p>

<p>It was never easy and I never enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I remember starting every race without imagining what it would be like to
finish it. I simply put one foot in front of the other and kept pace with a
buddy until I could see the finish line - then I would sprint across it like a
mad man and puke my guts out.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3291/3015371980_6874e1ab49.jpg" alt="cross country with
michael" /> I kept
it up a little bit in college but over the years simply gave up on it. I think
around 5 years ago I was still able to run at an 8 minute mile pace.
Eventually though my knee began to hurt when I ran. Without a doubt my pains
are a result of years of playing tennis aggressively. There was a point when I
was playing almost daily that I couldn&#8217;t imagine there being a ball that I
wouldn&#8217;t try to track down and return. One day though something clicked and
since then there wasn&#8217;t a hitting session or run that wouldn&#8217;t end with my
knee swelling up and me being barely able to walk for a day.</p>

<p>I asked a doctor what could be done. He looked at my knee and determined that
there wasn&#8217;t anything toren but there was a build up of cartilage that would
require surgery to remove. His advice: give up tennis - it simply wasn&#8217;t worth
going through surgery when my knee was only aggravated when I played tennis.</p>

<p>As you could imagine this didn&#8217;t sit well with me - after all tennis is
something that I love. It did force me to evaluate what exactly it was about
tennis that caused my knee to hurt. My conclusion was that it was caused by
the constant pounding, starting and stopping that occurs during tennis - all
of which is felt by my knee. Tennis shoes have an immense amount of padding on
the heel which only encourages you to drive your foot harder into the ground.</p>

<p>The more my knee hurt that more I hated myself for not running over the years.
I missed the days when I used to be able to fly across a field faster than the
wind. Now the very thought of it would cause my knee to ache.</p>

<p>My running stride in the past has always been very long. Where each stride I
would drive my heel into the ground and bound off of it like a deer. I used to
want to replicate the covers of running magazines that I saw when I was a kid.
Running shoes by their very nature encourage this type of stride despite how
un-natural it is. Try it for yourself - take off your shoes and go run across
a field. You will find that you will naturally land on the balls of your feet.</p>

<p>The human foot is the result of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution
and yet a couple of decades of marketing by shoe manufacturers have convinced
people that it is flawed and that they should be <em>corrected</em>. It was this line
of reasoning and the book Born to Run that lead me to buying the craziest
looking shoes that I had ever seen - Vibram Five Fingers.</p>

<p>I had put off buying a pair for well over a year. First because they aren&#8217;t
exactly good looking, and second because I had a perfectly good pair of
running shoes. The selection of these expensive running shoes were the result
of going to a running store and having my stride recorded and analyzed so that
I would have the perfect running shoe for my feet. Compared to any other shoe
that I had ever had - running in these felt great. The only problem though is
that whenever I ran fast, I would go into my comfortable stride that involved
driving my heels into the ground which would lead to my knee hurting and me
regretting my decision to run.</p>

<p>The basic point of Vibram Five Finger shoes is to replicate what it is like to
be barefooted while still having the excellent traction and durability of a
Vibram sole. I went with the KSO (keep stuff out) trek model. Vibram makes a
model that is geared specifically towards road running, but I wanted something
that I could take on trails while still looking some what inconspicuous. The
average VFF has wild colors that I think most VFF enthusiasts appreciate
because they love the attention that they bring. I just wanted to be able to
run pain free.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5029224752_a4d697649d.jpg" alt="run week progress
916-925" /></p>

<p>It has been about 10 days since I got my pair of VFF. During that time I have
logged 21 miles and ran more consistently than I have ever before - or been
able to in the past. It feels awesome to wake up and actually want to be able
to run again instead of dreading the pain that would follow.</p>

<p>My stride has changed drastically. I have been trying for the past year to run
on the balls of my feet, but VFF make it so much easier. Instead of long
strides I now take short, quick steps that land below my center of gravity
rather than in front of it.</p>

<p>The result of this new way of running is that my stride is way more economical
than it used to be and my dropping 5k time is proof of it. I now feel like I
can run longer and faster than before. Best of all my knee doesn&#8217;t hurt at all
after a run or even a weeks worth of runs. I have gone from running on average
15 miles a month at the beginning of the year - all which ended in pain - to
over 50 this month alone.</p>

<p>I have years to make up before I will be able to run at the speed that I ran
in high-school but thanks to Vibram Five Fingers I feel like it is possible
that I will be able to. As an added bonus in the last month I have lost 10
pounds as a result of running again. I still have about 20 pounds more to go
until I reach one of my goals of the year of getting down to 160 but thanks to
my new found love of running I am feeling lighter and healthier than I have
all year.</p>

<p>Took a small break 2 days during the week. On the 15th I gave into some ice
cream cravings. On the 17th I celebrated my 4th anniversary of dating my
girlfriend. We had a really nice dinner. Thankfully the damage doesn&#8217;t seem to
be too great.</p>
