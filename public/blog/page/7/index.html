  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been just about a day since I completed my first international flight
and arrived in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>My flight took me from Portland -> Seattle -> Reykjavik -> Copenhagen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773905873/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4773905873_9b8d0e6813_z%0A.jpg" alt="Got my tickets" /></a></p>

<p>I have always wanted to go to Iceland, unfortunately for this trip I could
only stay there for an hour. With customs, my stay there felt even shorter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774536948/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4774536948_5542de6%0A4a4_z.jpg" alt="Flying Over Iceland" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773905185/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4773905185_5e75dbab71_%0Az.jpg" alt="Iceland Airport" /></a></p>

<p>Landing in Denmark provided a much better view.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774535678/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4774535678_c79208a%0A801_z.jpg" alt="Approaching Denmark" /></a></p>

<p>Navigating through the Copenhagen airport was a painless experience. They
didn&#8217;t even bother to check our passports upon arriving. This is truly the
land of freakishly tall vikings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774543168/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4774543168_c849%0Aaa3ab6_z.jpg" alt="Arriving in Copenhagen" /></a></p>

<p>From the airport we rode a train to get to our apartment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773902847/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4773902847_84242%0A19d03_z.jpg" alt="Waiting for the Train" /></a></p>

</a></p>

<p>My initial impression of Copenhagen is just how clean and impressive the city
is. The streets were filled with people on bicycles - way more than were ever
in Portland.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773900005/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4773900005_b1911%0Aa27e8_z.jpg" alt="Going to my Apartment" /></a></p>

<p>If there was ever any need for further proof of what a simple creature I am
then just look at the beer that my girlfriend picked out for me without
asking. Despite not being able to read a word, she was able to pick out what
is now my favorite beer. Apparently juice + beer is delicious.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4774535018/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4774535018_97ea6f205%0A4_z.jpg" alt="New Favorite Beer" /></a></p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t fall asleep until well past midnight local time which is about a 9
hour time difference from Portland. It didn&#8217;t get dark till around 10:30. At
4:30 in the morning I was woken up by light pouring into our windows.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/4773895789/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4773895789_a2eeda%0A175b_z.jpg" alt="Outside my Apartment" /></a></p>

<p>I am now exhausted after spending the day in the office and surviving off of
around 5 cups of coffee.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two of my goals for this year are to finally get a passport and to work abroad
for 2 months. I wasn&#8217;t one of those fortunate kids who got to tour Europe out
of college or high school. After graduating I immediately began working and
aside from a trip back to Hawaii a few years ago I haven&#8217;t had the opportunity
to leave the main land - let alone go to another country.</p>

<h2>New Job</h2>

<p>In May I was hired on by a very hot company called Unity Technologies as a web
developer. I had been contracting with them for about a month prior to being
hired. They also flew me down to San Francisco in April to be their official
photographer and to document their time at the Game Developers Conference.
Unity has long been a competitor in the middleware game engine space with a
company I used to work for - GarageGames. While GG shifted their focus over
the last few years to other <a href="http://instantaction.com">things</a>, Unity focused
on improving their core products and have steadily gotten better, and more
profitable over the years.</p>

<p>One of my requirements for working with them was that I have the freedom to
continue living in Portland, rather than move to San Francisco where their
North American office is based. We agreed that I would occasionally (about
once a month) work at the office, but the rest of the time I would be free to
work anywhere else. It has worked out for the most part except that their
<em>primary</em> office (and where the rest of the developers work) are actually in
Copenhagen, which is about a 9 hour time difference to Portland.</p>

<h2>Going to Copenhagen</h2>

<p>My project(s) are for the most part independent of what the rest of the
developers at Unity are working on. I focus primarily on web related projects
(store, site, etc), while the rest of the Unity is focusing on engine and tool
development. Still our paths do occasionally cross so it makes perfect sense
for me to become better acquainted with them. The solution then is to fly my
girlfriend and I over for at least a month, set us up in a hotel, and force us
to enjoy Copenhagen during the summer.</p>

<p>A co-worker has a vacation coming up at the end of July so they wanted to make
getting me out there a top priority so that we would have plenty of time to
work together. This gave me just the excuse I needed to get my passport, and
also gets me half way through another goal of working abroad for 2 months.</p>

<p>On July 6th I will be taking my first international flight to Copenhagen where
I will be working on-site for at least 3-4 weeks.</p>

<h2>Passport Acquired</h2>

<p>I had always entertained the idea of getting a passport whenever I went to the
post office. When I finally did go that purpose though the place was packed
with people had the same idea. Thankfully I was 2nd in the line, because it
took the guy almost an hour to process me alone. We got the fastest processing
time possible and my passport arrived in just under 2 weeks.</p>

<h2>Beyond Copenhagen</h2>

<p>I ended up getting us one way tickets to avoid having to commit to a departure
city and to keep our travels open ended. There is just way to much of Europe
that I would like to explore but I have neither the time or the money to do it
right now. We would like to see some of the near by countries like Germany,
Belgium, and the Netherlands. I also wouldn&#8217;t mind being able to stay in a
single awesome city for a week and just explore the heck out of it. Either way
we have the month in Copenhagen to figure it out.</p>

<h2>Plans for this Site</h2>

<p>My plans are to be more active on this site in terms of documenting my
experiences with traveling - beyond my photography, though I promise there
will be plenty more of that. In preparation for my trip I finally graduated
from my flimsy $35 aluminum tripod that I got years ago to a nice, light,
travel-friendly carbon fiber Manfrotto tripod.</p>

<p>Expect lots of panoramas and HDR like shots in the future as we tour around
Copenhagen and beyond.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t very often that I get shots of myself, thankfully my girlfriend was
willing to help me out. Her parents are visiting from Korea and love to hike
as much as I do so we decided to give Dog Mountain a chance despite the
promise of wet weather.</p>

<p>Dog Mountain is 3.8 mile trip to the top, and it is all up hill. When we got
to the top it was enveloped in a cloud so there wasn&#8217;t much to look at.
Eventually there was a break in the clouds which revealed a spectacular view
of the gorge covered in wild flowers.</p>

<p>Located about 2 miles into the Eagle Creek trail in the Columbia River Gorge.</p>

<p>The water level is so high this time of year that you can&#8217;t view these falls
from the lower level without getting really wet and I didn&#8217;t want to risk my
gear. This is unfortunate because the falls looked amazing. The last time I
had a chance to get out here it was right before winter, so the water level
was much lower.</p>

<p>Eagle Creek in general is fantastic right now and is a Waterfall Wonderland
with tons of beautiful tiny waterfalls pouring out along the trail.</p>

<p>Coming from Eugene I am not used to local bands sounding good. They have the
instruments, and know how to play them but the end result usually isn&#8217;t all
that great. It is funny because a lot of really good bands have come out of
Eugene, but at some point the music scene decided to move to Portland. So with
some trepidation I agreed to catch a live show from a friend&#8217;s band, not
expecting much. If nothing else at least it would give me a chance hang out
with friends and try some music photography.</p>

<p>Thankfully the band - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Love-%0ALies-Dying/130327486451">Love Lies Dying</a> - was actually quite good. The show took place at the
<a href="http://www.ashstreetsaloon.com/">Ash Street Saloon</a>.</p>

<p>I was tempted to just sit back the entire time and just enjoy the show, but I
noticed that no one else was really taking pictures. My D90 is a good camera,
but when it comes to the kind of low light photography that most music
photography demands - well there is a lot left to be desired. If I were going
to try and make an honest living out of this sort of thing I would definitely
want a full frame camera like a Nikon D700 or a Canon 5d mk II. Regardless I
am a strong believer in working with the tools that I have, so with that in
mind I threw on my fastest lens and decided to test a few shots - only to find
a blurry mess. I tried again with a flash and found the results were clear but
the flash had washed out the ambient stage lighting.</p>

<p>I was just about ready to give up when I got inspired by the work of a flickr
contact of mine named Todd who runs the site
<a href="http://ishootshows.com/">ishootshows</a>. I actually fired up the flickr app on
my iphone and started browsing his
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toddowyoung/">stream</a> to pump myself up. I am
not going to pretend to be able to take as good of shots as Todd, but I wasn&#8217;t
going to leave the show without giving it a second try.</p>

<p><a href="http://za%0Adell.com/gallery/photo.php?id=4448850022"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4448850022_2444bc9509.jpg" alt="" /></a><a href="http://zadell.com/gallery/photo.php?id=4448071%0A445"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4%0A020/4448071445_e8d4cc2de7.jpg" alt="" /></a><a href="http:%0A//zadell.com/gallery/photo.php?id=4448846340"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4448846340_cf37fed23b.jpg" alt="" /></a><a href="http://zadell.com/gallery/photo.php?id=444%0A8068169"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.c%0Aom/4009/4448068169_311c631af2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In the end I had a great time and the band appreciated me shooting the show.
The lessons I learned: take lots of shots, at least some are bound to be clear
and make heavy use of Lightroom&#8217;s Luminance Noise Reduction.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I had an opportunity to go down to the bay area for a
photography gig while attending the Game Developers Conference. There is a lot
that I love about the Bay Area - in particular I love the start-up tech vibe
that everyone seems to bleed down there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the area of San Francisco that I was at wasn&#8217;t very inspiring.
Coming from Portland, that part of town was extremely dirty and filled with
crazy people. One morning I passed a girl yelling at a closed shop door, when
she didn&#8217;t get a response she moved on to a wall to continue her yelling.</p>

<p>One thing that did catch my eye though was the bizarre graffiti that seemed to
highlight every back alley that I passed.</p>

<p><a href="http:%0A//zadell.com/gallery/photo.php?id=4449196654"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4449196654_9f47e8fc50_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></a><a href="http://zadell.com/gallery/photo.php?id=444%0A9197604"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.c%0Aom/2692/4449197604_46de9f046e.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I still hope to move down there some day, but not that part of town.</p>
