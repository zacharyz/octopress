  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have wanted to get an HDTV for a while now. My 24&#8221; dell has served that duty
for a while, but the new apartment really encouraged something more. Initially
I had planned on waiting till December to make a purchase because the prices
of HDTVs have been dropping a lot. Almost $100 a month depending on where you
look. My friend Brett, who again lives right next store to me, has the same
layout and was hit with the same notion.</p>

<p>I think the bug really bit Brett when I sent him a link to a 37&#8221; Westinghouse.
It was cheap, and old, and refurbished, but it opened up his eyes to the fact
that he can use a tv that big as a 1080p monitor. From there he couldn&#8217;t help
himself but to check prices and find out whats best for him. He had settled on
one model, I had settled on another - cheaper model. So armed with the
knowledge the the current state of the HDTV market, we decided to see what we
could get around town.</p>

<p>At first Brett wasn&#8217;t convinced that B&amp;M stores were the way to go, as you can
get amazing deals online. But buying from a store makes returning the tv much
easier in case it is defected, additionally you get a better idea of the
picture quality and can pick it up from the store instead of waiting for it to
be delivered. I had read several stories about how guys went into Best Buy for
weeks to eye models and befriend the managers so they could save a couple
hundred on a set. So I knew it was possible to negotiate the price to an
extent.</p>

<p>Our plan was different though, we were going in with the simple strategy where
whoever was selling the tvs would have to decide between selling two HDTVs or
zero. You either dealt with both of us, or we walked out and you didn&#8217;t sell
anything. This made things pretty remarkable.</p>

<p>When we walked into Best Buy I could feel that the sales dudes knew what we
were up to. One guy looked at us 5 times. Each time he would run away and find
another customer rather than help us. Finally they sent a girl from appliances
to help us out. We explained what we were doing right of the bat, and I could
tell she was nervous. She was honest though and made it clear that she does
not make commission on sales. The big thing she said though was that typically
customers don&#8217;t walk in knowing what they want and the prices they expect to
pay like we did, so we knew we had a good advantage.</p>

<p>The best Best Buy can typically do is price match stores that are near. So we
started with my tv. Initially I had my eye on a Sharp Aquos 42&#8221; which is raved
about a lot on the interwebs. The price Best Buy had was around $1700. First
we got a Sears rep to confirm that they had it for $1499 with a $150 discount
if you sign up for a card. So Best Buy matched the $1350 price. Great. Best of
all though they offered a 0% interest, no payments until 2009 financing. I
don&#8217;t typically promote debt, I believe in not making purchases you can&#8217;t
afford. But I believe you can leverage debt. Being able to keep my money is a
bank account that generates interest, or paying over time at no penalty makes
sense. So for this reason alone I had determined that I would be walking out
of Best Buy that day with a tv.</p>

<p>Next on to Brett&#8217;s tv. He wanted a Samsung LN-T4661F - which is a 46&#8221; 1080p
lcd - one of the best reviewed hdtvs online. The price though was over a $1000
more than the 42&#8221; Sharp before price matching. The picture though was
noticeably better. The colors were much more vibrant and detailed. But not at
that price. So we got Best Buy to try and price match. First they called
around and managed to find it for a couple hundred less. That seemed
reasonable. You could get it for that price with shipping online but we wanted
to see if we could do better so we walked out and went to the local video only
store to see if they could drive a better bargain.</p>

<p>At the smaller store we were greeted by a guy who we had talked to earlier on
a phone when we were trying to get an idea of what the prices were on tvs. So
he knew our game plan ahead of time and was willing to play. The first thing I
did was grab a shot of the offered price with my phone - which was much lower
than what Best Buy was offering. The thing that impressed me most about this
guy is that he carried around a little piece of paper that showed all the
current market prices for the tvs. So he was right away able to determine a
price that was much lower than any other place, even online. It was around
$150 less than the asking price. He also offered the original price with a
free stand. Unfortunately he wasn&#8217;t willing to bargain much more beyond that
and couldn&#8217;t compete with Best Buy&#8217;s financing so we decided to pull one of
the better negotiating tricks - we walked out. Amazingly enough the guy didn&#8217;t
follow.</p>

<p>So back to Best Buy we went armed with this new incredibly low price, and a
picture to prove it. We found our friendly sales girl and told her the price.
She balked. It was $500 less than the asking price. She didn&#8217;t believe it
until I showed her the picture. To make it sweeter though I told her that if
she agreed to do it I would buy the very same tv. At that price and with the
financing it was worth it to me to get the more expensive, but noticeably
better tv. After trying to pitch us on buying additional accessories and
warranties, she caved and agreed to the price. Home free right?</p>

<p>On to check out, she was incredibly nervous but knew that if she didn&#8217;t make
the sale at that price we would be getting it from some place else. She tried
to pitch us on other things but could tell that we were not at all interested
in buying a warranty or paying a 500% premium on accessories which can be
found only for dirt cheap at monoprice.com.</p>

<p>Here is the deal with warranties. This is how Best Buy makes their money, they
are willing to price match anyone as they are usually able to sell warranties
on fear alone. They talk about how a repair costs several hundreds of dollars
and how the manufacturer will only cover the most basic of defects. What they
don&#8217;t cover though is silly stuff like damaging your display accidentally
while cleaning. If the stuff that they do cover were really an issue then
there would be so many class action lawsuits against television manufactures.
That obviously isn&#8217;t the case because these televisions are built with extreme
quality. So Best Buy is betting that the majority of warranties they sell will
never be used. It is like free money to them. Enough about warranties though,
back to the sale.</p>

<p>Before the sale could be completed the girl&#8217;s manager had to approve it. This
guy was obviously a seasoned sales dude. Immediately he asked her if she was
selling us warranties, I piped in to say that she had done an excellent job of
pitching it to us and we were considering them to hopefully save her some pain
later. He ignored it though and went into his spiel. He buys warranties on
everything. From his plasma, to his appliances to his portable dvd player -
well not that one he just replaces it when it dies. As he talked I couldn&#8217;t
help but notice his ear lobes were about an inch long and drooped and swayed
as he talked. This helped me cope with his bullshit. Once he was done, and
after a few questionable looks at our sales girl, he approved the sale.</p>

<p>We decided to wait till the next day to bring the tvs home. We came in a car
and they didn&#8217;t deliver. The next day though we ran into the same girl who
related about how the home theater department was berated pretty hard by
management that morning because of the sale she made. As I was waiting for
them to get my tv from the back I overheard tow junior sales dudes looking
over hdmi cables and wondering why they cost so much and what exactly they
did. Even they thought Best Buy was full of shit.</p>

<p>In total we saved over $1000 between the two of us and now each have an
incredibly stunning tv in our apartment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My buddies Sam and Brett helped me move into my new place yesterday.Ã‚Â  It
was such a good feeling walking away from that old apartment, which was a such
a huge dump. I refused to do any cleaning to the place beyond picking up my
trash, so good luck trying to clean that place Bell.</p>

<p>Initially I had considered hiring some people to do the move for me. I found a
bidding service that lets you set the amount you want to pay, and then people
bid for the right to move your stuff. I figured it would be like ebay, where
you set your max bid and it doesn&#8217;t go higher than that. Unfortunately bidding
started at my max, which was set unreasonably high, and the best bids were
never low enough. So we rented a uhaul instead, $50 later and our stuff was
moved.</p>

<p>The new place is amazing. Aside from having more room, it also has a better
layout, a deck, a garage (made unpacking so much easier), and a yard. Best of
all though is the location. The location of my last apartment was its best
feature. But this place does a good job of competing. Like the old place this
one has a Market of Choice near by, but this one is much bigger and feels a
lot nicer. Additionally there is a Wal-mart, Cafe Yum, and a ton of other
places to eat and drink at (no bars though). I think my favorite thing though,
which I only found out after I decided to live here, is that the swim and
tennis club is about 4 blocks from my door. That&#8217;s closer than the University
was to my old place. What&#8217;s incredible about all this is that the place is
very quiet compared to my old apartment despite being so close to so many
things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PdaNet is a program that works on windows mobile based phones that allows you
to use the data connection in conjunction with a computer. Since I have
unlimited data on my phone, it basically means I can have a net connection
wherever I get reception. Being away at <a href="http://www.xnagamefest.com">Gamefest</a>
in Seattle the past few days, I have had a lot of opportunities to take
advantage of this.</p>

<p>The free wifi at the convention center was horrible. Despite being a solid
connection it was so bogged down from all the other attendees that it was
unusable. In the hotel I was staying in they actually charge for a network
connection.</p>

<p>Pdanet to the rescue!</p>

<p>The connection itself is around 2Mb/s, which is more than adequate. I
certainly don&#8217;t plan on downloading huge files with it, but for checking my
email, browsing the web and watching youtube videos it kicks ass.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Little less than one month to go and I will be free of ever having to deal
with Bell Realty again.</p>

<p>I have admit over the last couple months I have been tempted to renew my
lease. My old room-mate left and got married to his childhood sweat-heart and
my neighbors from hell moved away - so I had the whole place to myself. On top
of that I got to have summer rates so the place has been dirt cheap and
probably more room than I needed.</p>

<p>Still I just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to wanting to live here for another year.
The place really is a dump compared to what I could get elsewhere. It was a
serious spider and insect problem - the entrance looks like a dungeon. The
apartment washer and drier is always never available and is constantly a mess
from other tenants. The only thing it really has going for it is the location,
but I honestly don&#8217;t think it is worth dealing with Bell any longer. Out of
the 10 units available in this apartment complex all but 3 are up for lease.
Likewise the apartment complex near by, also owned by Bell, has several units
available. Clearly people around Eugene have figured out that Bell is bad
news.</p>

<p>I put off looking for a new apartment until July as I figured any place I
found would not hold or wait until mid-August (when my lease ended) for me to
move in. So it wasn&#8217;t until recently that Brett and I started looking for some
place. We first looked into this great little duplex neighborhood made up of
64 units. Rent was about a $130 more than what I payed currently but the
places were huge. Well worth the money, especially since they were month to
month. The only thing wrong with the place was that they were incredibly far
away from work and everything else.</p>

<p>The next place we looked at though was more promising. It was another duplex
near Applewood apartments and near Gold&#8217;s Gym where I have been considering
getting a membership. Additionally it was close to a supermarket and a little
shopping area. It is also near a highway that leads right to work. So it was a
pretty good location over all. The duplex was about 30 more than what I
currently pay, had a deck, one car garage, a deck, a yard, a fireplace, a
washer and dryer hookup, and had more room over all with a nicer layout and
appliances. Unfortunately it was only one unit and Brett wasn&#8217;t into sharing a
two bedroom with me (and my girlfriend). We are both in a stage in our lives
where living alone makes sense. Thankfully there was a unit right next store
that was almost identical that was also for rent but not from the same dude.</p>

<p>So that day I called the Realtor that was renting the place. It was a little
bit more a month than what Brett would be paying but the place was in a lot
better condition. Best of all it would be available the same time as Brett&#8217;s
unit - mid August and was month to month. Perfect. So we found two places so
close to each other in a great location and for great prices. It was almost
serendipitous. But only if we both got them.</p>

<p>Brett applied for the duplex with me, in case I didn&#8217;t get the place I would
just take the one he was originally interested in. We filled out applications
and drove to the realtor to dropped them off. We called ahead and were told
there was a drop box to place the applications and application fees. This was
on a Friday. On Monday we called to check if they got the applications only to
find out that they didn&#8217;t. Apparently there was a cleaning crew over the
weekend who picked them up. At this point neither Brett nor I were happy. I
was potentially out of $100 in application fees and we were both out a lot of
personal information that we would rather not be without.</p>

<p>Thankfully a phone call later the Realtor was able to find out that neither of
the applications were lost and were in the hands of the owner. Unfortunately
for some odd reason they didn&#8217;t take personal checks, so we had to go in
anyway with cash.</p>

<p>It turned out I was the only one applying for the place so the chances of me
getting it were pretty high. So Brett backed out and committed to the other
unit. The only thing really stopping me from getting this place was getting
references from Bell. Great.</p>

<p>When I turned in the application I told them it was probably going to be a
hassle since I was with Bell, the girl immidiately rolled her eyes and was
like &#8220;ahh yes we know all about Bell.&#8221; It took them 6 faxes, an email from me,
and a week later before Bell finally confirmed my rental history.</p>

<p>So today I found out that I am approved for the place and I get to move into
it on the 15th. I am actually really excited about moving out of this
apartment and into a place that is so much nicer. Thankfully my last month of
rent is dirt cheap and pro-rated so I don&#8217;t feel bad about giving Bell a final
month&#8217;s rent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sprint sales reps are awesome. They have clear voices and are easy to
communicate with. They are great at selling phones. Beyond that - Fuck Sprint.</p>

<p>Today my Moto Q died. Thankfully it was the last day of my 30 day trial
period. So I called Sprint to send back my existing phone and to get a
different phone since I was tired of dealing with undependable phones.</p>

<p>It was relatively easy to get a rep who was able to print out a label for me
to return my phone. From there it was nothing but pain.</p>

<p>I want to get the Mogul by HTC. They managed to start selling it the day after
I originally ordered my Moto Q. It is another windows mobile phone only its
WM6 and a huge improvement over the other phones offered at the time. The
first rep I got barely spoke english and was actually trying to sell me the
phone. He started rattling off phone features &#8220;umm it has mp3, it has email,
it is good phone.&#8221; Keep in mind I was the one who told him the Mogul is the
phone I wanted to order. Then he told me I would have to pay full retail for
it. Then he hung up. WTF.</p>

<p>While on hold the office phone I was on managed to run out of juice but
magically my Moto Q managed to boot again. Apparently this is a common error
with Moto Qs.</p>

<p>A few more attempts at getting through only to be given 3 different automated
responses that all resulted in the number I was trying to call being down.</p>

<p>I once got through to a rep who wanted to forward me to the very same number -
which of course ended up in nothing again.I call sales again in hopes of
actually talking to someone who speaks english and get this girl. I explain
how the other number is down so she puts me on hold and waits for the number
to connect while I am on hold. Every 2-3 minutes she picks up and asks if I
would like to be on hold some more or hang up. After 1 hour they changed the
classical song to one that was much louder - this almost made me want to hang
up. 15 minutes more of this and I finally get through to a girl who sounds
Mexican. The first thing I do is try to take it off speaker phone so I can
actually talk to her&#8230; and I hang up the phone on accident.</p>

<p>At this point I am pissed. I immediately try and call the number I was trying
to connect with and was greeted by an automated voice saying the system was
down. So then I call back sales again and amazingly get a guy rep (first time
ever). I explain to him my situation and he actually does what everyone else
was transferring me to other people to do. The gist: in order to get a
different phone I have to send back my current phone and then order a new
phone. Otherwise I have to buy a full retail phone. So after numerous calls
and forwards and being on hold for most of the morning I get told something
that should have been answered by the first dude I talked to.</p>

<p>Fuck You Sprint customer service. But thanks dude who was able to actually be
helpful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We decided to try something different this year for the 4th. Instead of
attending a fireworks show we decided to camp out on the roof of my apartment.
There were scheduled to be three major fireworks shows and ideally they would
all be visible from my roof. In total we had 6 people up there enjoying drinks
and company.</p>

<p>I really wanted to use the opportunity to experiment with taking pictures of
fireworks. Up until this point I hadn&#8217;t experimented with the different
exposure settings on my camera nor had many opportunities to play with my
tripod.</p>

<p>The main obstacle was getting people on the roof. There aren&#8217;t exactly stairs
leading to the top. Instead you usually have to splinter-cell split step
between two walls until you get to the roof. This is fine for guys who rock
climb a lot but not for our girlfriends :/.</p>

<p>We ended up stacking some objects to make it easier. My girl was a great sport
about the whole thing even though I could tell it terrified her to be up
there.</p>

<p>When the fireworks started we were initially let down. Most of the fireworks
were below tree level and were barely visible from our position. We were close
to leaving when the big ones started. <img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/RoyG3%0AOOtL7I/AAAAAAAAAj0/fX2dg0o5pgw/s400/IMG_1174.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>From there it only got better. Having the tripod really help in developing
what ended up being 2 second long exposures per firework. One of the cool
things about the shots is that you can see the sky gradually get darker. <img src="h%0Attp://lh3.google.com/zacharyz/RoyG6eOtMFI/AAAAAAAAAlE/hgZAvJX4jwU/s400/IMG_118%0A4.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/RoyHNOOtMeI/AAAAAAAAAoM/IeMwuw9d6mI/%0As400/IMG_1210.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="http://lh3.google.com/zacharyz/RoyH1eOtM9I/AAAAAAAAAsE/%0AkoA0vhJTvIA/s400/IMG_1243.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/RoyIAOOtNFI/%0AAAAAAAAAAtE/CA99e0hJ55Y/s400/IMG_1251.JPG" alt="" /> The main show at Alton Baker part
was disappointing. It ended only 7 minutes after it was scheduled to start.
But over all everyone had a great time and I got around 75 shots to show for
it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After 2 years of being on Cingular I finally got sick of them raping me in the
ass and switched to a new phone service. What should have cost about $30 a
month was on average $60 a month due to BS charges by Cingular particularly
for worthless insurance, charging out the ass for using data, and text
messages.</p>

<p>I had the option to wait around for the Iphone but decided it wasn&#8217;t worth the
price and to be with Cingular any longer. I also shopped around a bit for what
other carriers were offering and was pretty disappointed when a friend turned
me on to <a href="http://www.fatwallet.com/t/18/680568/">Sprint&#8217;s SERO plan</a>.</p>

<p>What you get with SERO:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlimited Sprint Vision or Power Vision (data/interweb)</li>
<li>Unlimited Text Messages</li>
<li>Unlimited Mobile to Mobile</li>
<li>Unlimited Sprint Picture Mail</li>
<li>Unlimited Roaming</li>
<li>500 anytime minutes</li>
<li>Unlimited Nights &amp; Weekends (Starts @ 7PM)</li>
<li>Nationwide Long Distance</li>
<li>Crystal Clear Calls</li>
<li>Voice Mail</li>
<li>Caller ID</li>
<li>Call Waiting</li>
<li>Numeric Paging</li>
<li>Three-Way Calling
What does this all cost? $30. Yep, for half of what I was paying before I get
unlimited data and text messaging.</li>
</ul>


<p>I ended up going with the <a href="http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/q/q-experience/q.html">Moto
Q</a> for my new
phone. Its a window mobile 5 smart phone with a qwerty keyboard that is super
thin. After rebates the phone is practically free.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.motorola.com/mot/image/13/13964_MotImage.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am not totally sold on the phone just yet (I have 30 days to decide) but so
far it seems great. I love being able to browse the web and check my email
wherever I am. Windows mobile 5 sucks, but thats another story.</p>

<p>I made a trip with my girl last weekend and google maps was a life saver
navigating around Portland.</p>

<p>So if you are unhappy with your current phone plan or in the market for a new
one I whole heartedly recommend Sprint&#8217;s SERO plan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today marks the 10th anniversary of Radiohead&#8217;s release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer">OK
Computer</a>.</p>

<p>OK Computer was one of the first and only CDs I have ever bought. I knew who
Radiohead was before that album but it wasn&#8217;t until Paranoid Android did I
really take notice of &#8220;mainstream&#8221; music. Ten years later and Radiohead is
still one of my favorite bands and is up there with the Smashing Pumpkins who
recently got back together again.</p>

<p>I hope to see them both in concert some day!</p>

<p>On another note my neighbors from hell finally moved today. No I didn&#8217;t say
good-bye. I did get to see their ragged couches out by the dumpster. For a
moment I contemplated claiming them then I remembered how disgusting those two
were.</p>

<p>My room-mate moved out at the beginning of the month and took all his clutter
so I suddenly found myself with more room than I know what to do with. The
first thing I did was clean up the place. I discovered several surfaces that
were white that I wasn&#8217;t aware of. I also converted the living room to my main
bedroom. Its really nice waking up to a nice view of the river with natural
lighting. Its a shame Bell are such complete cock whores otherwise I would
gladly live here.</p>

<p>Apartment Living is good once again, at least for the next few months.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The good news is that my neighbors that I hate so much are moving out in June.
The bad news is that my lease is almost up and due to Bell Realty, the
apartment&#8217;s new management, I am 99% certain I won&#8217;t be renewing.</p>

<p>In April Bell sent out these letters asking if you wanted to renew the lease.
That&#8217;s 4 months before the lease ended. If you didn&#8217;t agree to renew they
immediately put your place up on their site advertising its available.</p>

<p>I called up Bell and explained why I wasn&#8217;t willing to immediately renew
because the place had basically been lived in constantly since 2001 without
being cleaned once. So the only way I was going to renew the lease there was
if they replaced all the carpets and appliances and cleaned up the place. They
agreed to this with the only issue being that I move out for 2 weeks while
they did the cleaning. This wasn&#8217;t a problem because I could just move my
stuff next store into my friend&#8217;s place while they did the cleaning. Only
apparently they had leased out my friend&#8217;s place while he was still in it.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right. 4 months left and they had already leased the place to someone
else. To make matters worse its the girls who live directly below him. When he
asked Bell &#8220;Wtf?&#8221; they responded that he couldn&#8217;t apply for the same apartment
that he lived in. Swell.</p>

<p>At this point we weren&#8217;t exactly thrilled. The main draw of living in such a
shitty apartment was that I was living next to a good friend and co-worker. If
he is getting the boot then the place isn&#8217;t nearly as attractive. Additionally
I wouldn&#8217;t be able to stay at his place while they cleaned.</p>

<p>So we wrote back Bell and tried to reason with them how it was ridiculous to
expect someone to commit 4 months in advance to renewing a lease. We even went
so far as to say that if my friend wasn&#8217;t allowed to renew then I wouldn&#8217;t be
renewing either. Two weeks past before we got a reply. Apparently the girl we
were in contact with decided to go on vacation and during that time the girls
who applied to the place had given their deposit. Her reply? Tough shit.</p>

<p>So it looks like I have two months to find a new place because at this point
there is no way I am willing to give these fucks anymore money.</p>

<p>Word to the wise: Stay clear of Bell Realty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been a while since I got a new pair of tennis shoes. I have wide feet
and have been a big fan of the nike air resolve line of shoes. They are a few
seasons old so you can find them for cheap. The main thing that drew me to
them is that they are built like tanks.</p>

<p><img src="http://rs.tennis-warehouse.com/tw/ProductImages/NMRW.JPG" alt="" /><img src="http://rs%0A.tennis-warehouse.com/tw/ProductImages/NAMRPLB.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is hard to tell from those images but the toe area is surrounded by some
fairly durable plastic. Still, after about 9 months of play I managed to grind
that plastic away. My main issue with those shoes is that the durability came
at the cost of weight. They come in at around 16.9 ounces. Opponents consider
me pretty speedy around the court but I always felt like I was weighed down by
those shoes.</p>

<p>While returning a demo racquet at the local tennis shop today I ended up
getting a pair of Nike Max Breathe Free IIs.</p>

<p><img src="http://rs.tennis-warehouse.com/tw/ProductImages/AMBFWBB.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>They came pretty highly recommended on the tennis-warehouse forums, and were
the best fitting shoes out of the bunch that I tried. They come in at about
15.5 ounces which on paper doesn&#8217;t seem all that much lighter. But on court
today turned out to be a drastic difference. My hitting partner remarked on
several occasions that I was able to track down shots he thought were
impossible to retrieve. They definitely felt a lot lighter and more
maneuverable than any tennis shoe that I have used before.</p>

<p>They may not appear to be as durable as the air resolves but they still come
with a 6 month warranty. So if I play like I have been playing I will most
likely get a second pair for free.</p>

<p>On another note just before winning my 4th straight game of 21 I managed to
roll my ankle. Thankfully it doesn&#8217;t appear to be as bad as previous rolls :/.</p>
