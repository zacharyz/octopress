<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>1838</strong> calories under budget for the week. Lost <strong>2.8 pounds</strong> this week.<br/>
Another strong week and I did it even while indulging in a delicious
Thanksgiving Dinner. You will notice a small uptick on my weight loss graph
thanks to turkey.</p>

<p>I have been very strict when it comes to obeying my calorie budget and so far
the pounds have been flying off. I begin the new week at 164 lbs leaving just
4 more pounds to go before I reach my goal.</p>

<p>I have found that green tea has been my greatest weapon towards managing any
food cravings. Combine that with smaller food portions over all and it has
made weight loss seem easy.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year I set a goal of getting down to 165 and it feels
good to complete yet another goal for the year. I am still determined to reach
my goal of losing 30 pounds over all though.</p>

<p>For the last couple of weeks I have been sick and am slowly recovering from my
ankle injury that has prevented me from exercising. I hope that this is the
final week that I will have to deal with either issue.</p>

<p>Just 4 pounds left - I can do this!</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>2743</strong> calories under budget for the week. Lost <strong>2.8 pounds</strong> this week.<br/>
What is this? An actual good week for weight loss? It feels like I was stuck
in the low 170s for a while and then this week I lost nearly 4 pounds (I
weighed in this morning at 166.8). All this despite not being able to run and
having a cold. It would be easy to point towards my cold as the source of my
weight loss, and that may turn out to be the case later, but it hasn&#8217;t been
the sort of cold that has resulted in me puking a lot, so I don&#8217;t think that
will be the case. Instead I look towards the strong calorie restriction that I
have been doing. Because I haven&#8217;t been exercising I haven&#8217;t needed to eat as
much I usually do, which means I have been consuming far less calories then
previously.</p>

<p>I also believe that I gave my body some time to recover from my trip, so once
it fully digested everything the weight started to fall off. I didn&#8217;t even get
to see 169, as I went straight to 168.8 from the 170s, as I mentioned in an
earlier post.</p>

<p>If I can continue with this weight loss I am on schedule to complete my goal
mid-December. This doesn&#8217;t factor in Thanksgiving of course. Still this means
it may actually be possible to make my goal before the New Year.</p>

go" /></p>

<p>Those last 10 pounds took quite a bit longer than the first. Because of this I
almost feel like I have lost some perspective on how big a change it was for
me. My self image increased drastically going from 180-170. The first 10 were
rewarding but I couldn&#8217;t really see the difference, with these last 10 it is
much more apparent.</p>

<p>I now have a BMI below 24.2, which means I am now at <em>normal weight</em>.</p>

<p>It was actually towards the end of October that I saw hints of being this low.
After major runs or tennis I would be in the low 170s. I figured with the way
I was going I would be in the 160s in no time. Then a couple of weeks ago (to
this day) I did something really dumb and ran on a strained ankle. Two weeks
later and that ankle is still hurting because of it. Then I went on a near
week long business trip that really tested my dieting resolve. Mid-way through
that I caught a cold - which I have spent the week fighting off. So the last
couple of weeks have put a major damper on my weight loss. I would guess the
last 3-4 pounds that I have lost have been exclusively because of dieting,
which is odd to me because I have relied so much on exercising for the first
16 pounds.</p>

<p>Today means I only have 8.8 pounds to go before I reach my goal of getting to
160. That number looks way smaller than 20 did a month and a half ago but it
looks huge when you consider that I will be attempting it by New Years -
especially during the holidays.</p>

<p>Part of my motivation for doing it before the New Year is so that I will be
able to go into the new year knowing that I am already at a good weight. So
instead of having to make yet another New Year&#8217;s resolution of having to lose
weight I can make something else - like putting weight on (muscle), or even
just maintaining my weight.</p>

<p>Knowing how hard it was to lose these last 10 pounds makes me question if it
is even possible to lose another before the year ends with Thanksgiving and
Christmas coming up. We&#8217;ll see how well that goes.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>389 calories</strong> over budget for the week. Lost <strong>0 pounds</strong> this week.<br/>
Injured and sick while on a company trip where they were paying for all the
food and drinks I could handle. How do you think things went? Despite several
days where I was over budget I was able to remarkable maintain my current
weight of 170.6.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want <em>not</em> enjoy myself so I picked and chose what calories I did
enjoy. White Mocha at Starbucks? Pass. Ginger Ale? Pass. Instead I saved
myself for delicious steaks and ramen and cut the easy snacks the rest of the
time.</p>

<p>So while I did enjoy myself I did try to stick to my calorie budget and the
results were that I was able to maintain my current weight. This makes me
happy but at the time it freaks me out because if it was that hard to simply
maintain my current weight then what is going to happen when I didn&#8217;t have a
budget?</p>

<p>Not everyone can watch their diet, exercise or expect to be healthy every day.
If I wasn&#8217;t actively tracking my calories I would have been clueless as to how
much I was actually eating and honestly it never felt like I was eating very
much.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I plan to be recovering from the cold I got last week
and resting my ankle. Hopefully next week I will be healthy enough to start
exercising again otherwise this week is going to be another week of
maintenance.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>3800</strong> calories under budget for the week. Lost <strong>1.4 pounds</strong> this week.<br/>
This week I continued where I left off and started upping my running distance
to 10ks. To mix it up some I tried to see how fast I could run a 5k.
Previously my fastest time was 29:06, I was able to destroy it with a time of
26:07. I decided to follow up this run with another 10k run on Friday that
didn&#8217;t end so well. With about 2 miles left I felt my left ankle cramp some -
being a complete moron I decided to run through it for the rest of the run. I
can&#8217;t stress just how bad an idea this was. If your body hurts - listen to it.
It turns out that it wasn&#8217;t a cramp but a strain, and by running on it longer
for the next two miles I was just making it worse. For the rest of the week I
was unable to run - or even walk for that matter.</p>

<p>I also decided that I was going to quit my martial arts class. Studying jiu
jitsu and muay thai is actually something that I enjoyed quite a bit - but the
school itself not so much. At some point I got turned off because I kept being
grouped up with people who had even less experience than I had and by the
feeling that the people who were running the school were more interested in
getting me to test for belts rather than improving. This is unfortunate
because I was planning on relying on having the gym available to work out when
it gets too cold to run.</p>

<p>My main goal for this week was to get below 170 before a business trip in the
next week. My injury unfortunately got in the way of my progress and instead I
had to rely on strictly dieting - but I was able to get down to 170.6.</p>

<p>I was in Montreal for the past week to attend <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite
2010</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first time that I have traveled to Canada, so add one more country
to the <em>list</em> of new countries I have visited this year.</p>

<p>Montreal felt very European to me with its architecture and cobble stone
streets. This contrasted greatly with the people who lived there. At one
moment I could be sitting next to a group of people speaking perfect English
as they discussed video games, then in the next I would be surrounded by
people who only spoke French.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5167757288/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5167757288_%0Ac1c00694a8_z.jpg" alt="Old Town Montreal Panorama" /></a></p>

<p>I am not used to being so well treated on a company trip. I am used to sharing
cheap motels with co-workers as we tested how many we can pile in a single
room. For this trip each of us were setup in 4 star hotels in the middle of
Old Town Montreal, just a block away from the <a href="http://www.basiliquenddm.org/en/">Notre-Dame Basilica of
Montreal</a>.</p>

<p>Overall Montreal was a beautiful city with nice people and great food I just
wish I didn&#8217;t get sick mid-trip and was able to appreciate it more.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>630 calories</strong> under budget for the week. Lost <strong>0.2 pounds</strong> this week.<br/>
Talk about a week of ups and downs.</p>

<p>This is without a doubt my <em>worst</em> week of dieting since I began this
challenge. I flew down to San Francisco for a company meeting and dinner which
resulted in a huge spike in my weight. It was the combination of lots of good
beer, mediocre food and no exercise (beyond walking to the office). When I got
back I saw that I had gained about 2 pounds. So instead of getting down to
170, I found myself back up to 175.</p>

<p>How did I respond to this? By going on <a href="http://nikerunnin%0Ag.nike.com/nikeos/p/nikeplus/en_US/plus/?sitesrc=twit_ab_plus#//runs/detail/12%0A16555972/1370811448/all/allRuns/">my longest run ever</a> - 10k or 6.2 miles. Not even in high-school
did I run that far without stopping, this time I did it easily. At the
beginning of this challenge I was barely running 5k, and this week I was able
to double that and do it at a good pace as well.</p>

<p>The progress didn&#8217;t last long though as I soon had to go to a buffet with my
girlfriend&#8217;s family. It was the last night of the season that they would be
serving lobster, so we just had to attend. Of course I was way over budget. To
respond to this though everyone went on a 2.5 hour hike. This is the first
time that I have hiked in my VFF trek shoes and they were perfect for the
task.</p>

<p>At the end of the week I was <em>barely</em> under budget. In the morning though I
found myself at 172 so I <em>did</em> make some progress. It is only going to get
harder though as the weather gets wetter and with an upcoming (week long) trip
to Montreal coming up but I am still committed to getting this weight off.</p>

<p>I have it easy being able to eat most of my meals at home. I didn&#8217;t go out of
my way to indulge this week, it was only a result of socializing with
coworkers and family - the sort of things that everybody goes through on a
daily basis and yet it was enough to have a negative impact on my diet. Some
times dieting is so easy - keep your calories below your budget and exercise -
and yet in reality it can be a huge challenge with how plentiful unhealthy
food is in our society.</p>

<p>The Gorge is absolutely stunning right now. The water levels are high and the
trees are filled with oranges and yellows. If you can find a dry enough day as
I was lucky enough to this weekend then you need to do yourself a favor and
make your way out there before all the color disappears.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5137536926/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5137536926_069%0A1dc3087_z.jpg" alt="Multnomah Falls at Fall" /></a></p>

<p>This was my first hike in my Vibram Five Finger Trek shoes and it was a
breeze. They handled the rocky uphill climb with ease and were still
comfortable after I waded into the cold water to get the shots that I wanted.</p>

<p>It was good to see a healthy amount of photographers out with tripods (I
counted about ten). I don&#8217;t think people realize how much better their
waterfall shots will be if they use one as it is nearly impossible to get a
sharp shot that has that silky water effect that can only be achieved by
having a shot that is exposed for 1-2 seconds. One guy had a $3000 camera and
was convinced he didn&#8217;t need to use my tripod when I offered it because he
felt that his expensive camera would be enough.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>2,572 calories</strong> under budget for the week. Lost <strong>1.8 pounds</strong> this week.<br/>
Nothing magical happened this week. Still making steady progress, and in a
week or two I will begin to dip into the 160s for the first time. I am now
firmly half way towards my goal and can visibly tell that I am making
progress.</p>

<p>On the running front I have been shaving off minutes on my 4 mile times. Today
alone I ran my fastest mile and my fastest 4 mile pace since I started running
again. I am slowly moving towards running at a 9 min/mile pace. There are
times when I really enjoy running and it feels like I am flying through my
route thanks to my vibram five fingers.</p>
