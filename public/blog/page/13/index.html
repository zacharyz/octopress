  <div class="entry-content"><p>I missed out on the last generation of consoles. I picked up a used Dreamcast
and Gamecube to play Zeldas but I completely missed out on all the great
Playstation 2 and Xbox games. There were a ton of quality games released on
those systems that I never got to play. Recently I managed to get a hold of a
Playstation 3 for basically free, so suddenly I have access to all those great
games I missed on the Playstation 2 - which was the last generation&#8217;s clear
winner in the console wars. Additionally I finally get to take part in
&#8220;caring&#8221; about consoles.</p>

<p>I have had a lot of experience with the Xbox 360 and considered it the
superior console. From a technological perspective the PS3 is better, but the
360&#8217;s slicker dev tools and online integration have always made it more
appealing both as a gamer and as a developer. The price of the PS3 has always
been a major turn off as well. Why would anyone pay $600 for a console that
had less games and less online integration? The main reasons why I jumped at
the opportunity to get a PS3 was the chance to having a blu-ray player and the
chance to play old PS2 games. But now that I have one I see its much more.</p>

<p>It is nice being in a position where I don&#8217;t have to be a fanboi who roots for
one console over the other. It puts me in a position to see each console&#8217;s
merits for what they are.</p>

<p><img src="http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photos/061115/061115_playsta%0Ation3_vlg_1p.widec.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first thing that really stood out to me is the PS3&#8217;s slick piano black
finish. It is damn sexy. Then I fired it up and found out that it operated
very quietly and had built in Wifi. In minutes I was connected to my network
and was able to access sony&#8217;s free online network. I was able to download
trailers, demos and games with little effort. This is in contrast to having to
buy additional components to use Wifi with the 360.</p>

<p>I have never been a fan of the 360&#8217;s interface. It&#8217;s pretty, but from a
usability perspective it always seemed very clunky and slow to me. I think it
was actually initially designed by a local flash company here in Eugene, which
is cool but doesn&#8217;t make it suck less. By comparison the PS3&#8217;s interface can
be considered minimalists (which is ironic since the PS3&#8217;s OS is considerably
larger than the 360s). All the categories are represented by clean icons that
I can quickly navigate to find exactly what I need. I don&#8217;t like the fact that
every time you access the 360&#8217;s interface from a game or want to change
something that you have to wait for things to happen. With the PS3 it&#8217;s all a
lot snappier.</p>

<p>So far I have played mostly PS2 games. I have been enjoying the heck out of
Final Fantasy XII and the girl and I both loved Katamari Damacy. I also picked
up Shadows of the Colossus. My &#8220;to play&#8221; list for PS2 games alone is fairly
extensive.</p>

<p>For PS3 games I have tried out Resistance: Fall of Man, Virtua Fighter 5, and
am getting Motorstorm soon. Resistance has gotten very little play from me and
probably won&#8217;t be getting much more. I have loads of respect for Insomnia for
being able to put out a game with such a high level of polish as a launch
title, but the game itself is nothing more than a generic shooter to me, which
I don&#8217;t find all that stimulating. It did give me the opportunity to
experience my first online console fps. I was able to update the game and find
a server fast enough. Once I was there though it was odd facing a bunch of
people who didn&#8217;t know how to circle strafe around opponents. So I was at the
tops of the ffa matches in no time.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.gamecrazy.com/images/games/boxart/11341.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Virtua Fighter 5 is something else. Visually it is amazing. easily the best
looking fighter I have ever seen. Virtua Fighter 2 was one of the first games
to get me interested in computer graphics. As far as the fighting system goes
- so far I am loving it. I can see it taking months before I consider myself
proficient at a single fighter, which I consider a good thing. But the problem
is there isn&#8217;t anyone to fight against. I don&#8217;t know of a single other person
who owns a PS3, so finding people who are able to practice the game is pretty
much impossible. Additionally Sega neglected to include online multiplayer.
Given the nature of VF5&#8217;s hit detection, its understandable, but I would have
liked something. In the past versions they had a feature that allowed you to
train an AI to play in your style. So you could go to an arcade and fight
against an AI but it would be like fighting against a real player. How awesome
would it have been to be able to trade &#8220;bots&#8221; with friends online? I really
feel Sega dropped the ball with this.</p>

<p>The overall price of games this generation is really turning me off. So far I
have only been getting games from ebay. $40 + shipping is my limit for games
in general. Charging $60 and expecting people to shell out more for additional
content is just raping the consumer. The biggest issue I see the PS3 having is
the complete lack of games. I would consider VF5 to be the only clear standout
PS3 currently out and soon the 360 will have a port. If I was in it for PS3
games alone I would be a very sad gamer. Thankfully there are some very nice
titles coming out that makes me glad that I have the console. The big
standouts are Metal Gear Solid 4, Ninja Gaiden Sigma (I missed the original),
Final Fantasy XIII, Heavenly Sword, Uncharted: Drake&#8217;s Treasure, God of War 3,
LittleBigPlanet and White Knight Story.</p>

<p>Something that has really peaked my interest lately is PS3&#8217;s Home, which is a
Second Life like online system Sony is making to push games and content to
people. The system will be free and reminds me of Snowcrash&#8217;s Metaverse. The
potential for such a system is huge.</p>

<p>I really like how the system doesn&#8217;t restrict you into using propriety
accessories. For instance if I wanted to update the harddrive from the 60GB
one that the system comes with I can get one off the shelf. The 360 requires
you to get a specialized one that costs almost twice as much as a generic one.
Also components like headsets are just bluetooth. So I can pickup any
bluetooth headset and use it with the PS3.</p>

<p>The system is costing Sony a load of cash. This past quarter Sony has lost
more than ever before. Still I can&#8217;t see the PS3 failing. It is a good system
and once developers learn how to harness all of its potential (and Sony is
really giving developers incentives to do so) I believe PS3 is really going to
surprise a lot of people.</p>

<p>Things that I like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Built in Wifi</li>
<li>Clean Interface</li>
<li>Free Online network</li>
<li>Near Silent Operation</li>
<li>Slick Piano Black Finish</li>
<li>Future Potential</li>
<li><p>Quality non-propriety components
Things I can&#8217;t stand:</p></li>
<li><p>Price of games</p></li>
<li>Lack of games</li>
<li>Puts out a ton of heat and uses up a lot of juice
On another note what the heck is the deal with having HD game consoles ship
without HD cables? I had to go all over town looking for a place that carried
component cables. The gamestop in the mall didn&#8217;t even know what they were,
let alone have them in stock.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While shopping at the local Korean food store I stumbled upon what may be the
greatest candy ever. Its made by a Japanese company named Kasugai. The candy
is simply called &#8220;gami&#8221; or gummy. So the two I have here are Grape and Litchi
Gummy.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/204/508946391_a631ea6737.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>They come in multiple flavors - so far I have tried Litchi, Grape, and
Strawberry and all three have tasted very much like the actual fruits.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those who live in Eugene know that the place is situated between two buttes.
The closest located in northern Eugene is Skinner&#8217;s butte (who principle
Skinner on the Simpsons get his name from) and the other located on the
southern end called Spencer&#8217;s Butte. Spencer&#8217;s is more of a hike while the
other has a fun rock climbing face.</p>

<p>Last weekend Brett, Craig and I decided to enjoy the weather and hit up
Spencer&#8217;s for a quick hike and hopefully make it fast enough to catch the
sunset from atop the butte. We also used the chance to play with our cameras.
Brett has a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi so I was pretty interested in how my
&#8220;super zoom&#8221; camera would compare in the lighting conditions.</p>

<p>Right off the back Brett&#8217;s camera was able to take better shots of Craig and I
than I have him.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/200/493396217_29d4456d11.jpg" alt="proof that you can hike in
crocs" /></p>

<p>All my shots of him came out blurry due to the lighting and our movement.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/206/493425251_1a19e64474.jpg" alt="blurry mess" /></p>

<p>The conditions were a lot muddier than I had ever experienced before I prior
hikes, but otherwise it was a fun hike. I managed to catch a lot of &#8220;sun
behind the branches&#8221; shots. I think mine turned out nicer over all than
Brett&#8217;s.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/227/493368006_e506e848a9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We arrived at the top to find a few people already there. The &#8220;seal&#8221; that
marked the top of the butte was removed and in its place was a tree branch
that was ideal for steadying our cameras.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/215/493372440_6c945ac5a5.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/189/493372350_f3c28211f0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There was a bunch of birds flying about, which gave me a good opportunity to
test out my zoom against moving targets.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/227/493368954_e3f97dd06f.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was able to get in pretty close and see that what I first thought were
hawks, were in fact buzzards.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/493368942_7afb1cf6fd.jpg" alt="buzzards" />
<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/222/493393113_ce34ca5437.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course we took a bunch of shots of the sunset and surrounding scenery.
<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/227/493368744_910ae70f68.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/205/493391985_0106889001.jpg" alt="setting

<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/196/493369056_a3253977f7.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=493368744&amp;size=m" alt="" /></p>

<p>I grabbed this next shot on our way back down. Craig had thought it would make
a good shot. Brett&#8217;s version had actually turned out washed out with very
little detail and the surrounding trees black.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/198/493369346_a980f7126e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The trip down was actually a lot of fun. Rather than go the way we came we
were recommended by a fellow hiker to go down the other side, which was far
steeper but would eventually meet up with our original path. The steepness
combined with the mud made for a lot of moments where we were skiing down the
slopes.</p>

<p>Overall it made for a pleasant evening hike that provided some great exercise
and photos.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah we have heard that news a million times before over the years. What is
different is that he has been retired from tennis for almost 4 years now and
that he won a title over the weekend and that it was on clay. He did it in
Boston - along the way beat a bunch of old champions like McEnroe and Martin.</p>

<p>Why is this remarkable? Well apparently he is using a new racquet after using
the same exact racquet for the majority of his career. The lighter and bigger
racquet allows him to hit the ball better than he could in his prime
(according to him and the guys he beat). Whoa what does this mean!? I could
use this post to go into how pros don&#8217;t use newer racquets when newer models
come out and instead use what people call &#8220;paint jobs&#8221;, but I will save that
for another post. Without a doubt though Sampras refused to even paint his
racquets different colors in the past so he is actually pimping new
technology.</p>

<p>Sampras and Federer played once at Wimbledon in 2001. That was was passed
Sampras&#8217; prime but would still go on to win the USO the next year and Federer
wouldn&#8217;t reach his stride from another couple years. Regardless the two had an
epic battle 7-6(7) 5-7 6-4 6-7(2) 7-5 with Federer winning the match. Tennis
buffs will remember this match as a passing of the torch sort of moment.
Everyone could see the potential that Federer had from that match.</p>

<p>Federer obviously looked up to Sampras. At the time they used the same shoes,
the same racquet and even today his service motion is very similar (same
motion for all his serves).</p>

<p>Last year when Sampras got tooled by Robby Ginepri in an exhibition match I
was one of the few people who didn&#8217;t think Sampras had a chance to come back
and face Federer. The only reason why that match was as close as it was, is
because Ginepri made it close. Sampras&#8217;s strokes were horrible and he could
barely keep a backhand in. The only thing he had was his serve and volley. He
definitely made a lot of great volleys that game, that were better than
anything you see on the pro tour today. But they weren&#8217;t enough to win
matches. But wait - now he is hitting the ball cleaner than in his prime?</p>

<p>If you have watched Wimbledon before you will notice that by the end of the
tournament the courts are brown and dead where the players spend the most
time. When Sampras played there was a clear path to the net and around it from
all the serve and volleyers that dominated the game - Sampras included. But
the last few years this hasn&#8217;t been the case and instead the majority of the
court is green except behind the baseline.</p>

<p>Serve and Volley is the ideal strategy for Wimbledon because the balls move so
fast and stays low on the grass surface. So by serve and volleying you speed
up the game and limit how much time your opponent can take a shot. Grass also
has a tendency to have irregular bounces making it hard to judge shots. This
is in contrast to hardcourts and clay courts where the ball bounces more and
gives players more time to focus their shots.</p>

<p>So the place that Sampras won so many times is dominated by a strategy that
Sampras eats for breakfast? That has got to get the guy thinking with his
current form.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not going to play Wimbledon again. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m curious how
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d do, especially with all the guys staying back. I always licked my
chops when I saw baselinersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦A lot of things come into play. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
a lot of work. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a daily grind. I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play Wimbledon
just to play. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d play to win. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got to be a reason to
come back, and there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a reason. To come back for one event is
crazy.Ã¢â‚¬Â - Pete.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are currently no strict SVers on tour at the moment who have a chance at
winning Wimbledon. Tim Henman is nearing retirement and his serve and volley
is no where near that of Sampras. Mario Ancic isn&#8217;t living up to his potential
and seems to be more of baseliner these days. Taylor Dent is recovering from
surgery so who knows when he can play again. Mark Philippoussis hasn&#8217;t been
competitive since getting destroyed by Federer in the 2003 final. The only
other guy to impress me - Takeo Suzuki isn&#8217;t even in the top 300 and hasn&#8217;t
been beyond the round of 64 at Wimbledon before. So players on tour aren&#8217;t
facing the sort of SV game that Sampras can bring.</p>

<p>The big question that Sampras needs to answer before he can even entertain
taking on Wimbledon is his fitness. He doesn&#8217;t have the fitness to play on
tour and won&#8217;t have it anytime soon. But his ability to make points extremely
short on grass makes Wimbledon, more so than any other slam, a possibility.</p>

<p>Personally I would love to see Sampras do a best of 3 set exhibition match
again Federer to answer the &#8220;What If?&#8221; question that has been plaguing
everyone since their 2001 battle. What if Sampras in his prime faced Federer
in his prime? I am not sure but I would love to find out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It looks like Canon has already made my S3 IS obsolete by announcing today the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0705/07050703canons5is.asp">Canon S5 IS</a>. For
some reason they decided to skip the S4. I can&#8217;t say I am very impressed with
the upgrade. For about $200 more you get 2 more mega pixels (not useful for
me), a larger LCD (meh they didn&#8217;t improve the AVF), 1600 ISO (800 is almost
useless on the S3) and face detection. Additionally they included a little
feature that auto-focuses during continuous shots (pretty cool!). I think the
face detection is the only thing I would really want. For that price though I
would just pick up a used SLR.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got to see the Decemberists for the first time in concert on Thursday with
my girlfriend. I have been listening to them for just over a year now but
wasn&#8217;t very enthusiastic about their new stuff aside from a few songs.
Thankfully they sound a million times better live than they do recorded, which
is remarkable considering how awesome they usually sound.</p>

<p>Colin Meloy has an amazing voice and stage presence for a nerd. I couldn&#8217;t
help but thinking while watching him perform that even nerds can be rock
stars.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/210/483594993_e4c4cfb50b.jpg" alt="colin meloy rockin
out" /></p>

<p>They opened with Oceanside off their 5 songs album, which is one of my
favorite songs. Then they played their newer stuff with some chick from the
opening band singing the female part in Yankee Bayonet. She sounded a little
like Dido, which is a good thing, and put a softer edge to the song.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/215/483594959_8074211ad9.jpg" alt="yankee bayonet" /></p>

<p>One of the things that I have grown to like about Eugene is that a lot of
artists that I like so much have roots out of Eugene. Meloy used to go to the
local university and the bassist used to work at one of the local music places
called the WoW theater before joining the band.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/220/483561378_82211adbfe.jpg" alt="the band" /></p>

<p>That girl playing the huge keyboard covered the rest of the female lyrics.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the show was when Colin Meloy took a camera from
someone in the front row of the audience and started taking pictures of
himself and everyone in the band.</p>

<p>The main highlight though was The Mariner&#8217;s Revenge Song which didn&#8217;t happen
until they came back on for the obligatory encore. That was the song that got
me hooked into the indi-folk style that The Decemberists do so well.</p>

<p>Aside from being the first show I saw at the Macdonald theater it also gave me
an opportunity to play with my new camera in such a dark setting. Its a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06022111canons3is.asp">Canon
S3 IS</a> and
considering I was on the balcony at the very back of the theater I think it
did an admirable job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Getting hit with a big fat sound violation on a Saturday afternoon didn&#8217;t sit
very well with Chris. A few days later we had talk. We had talked a couple
times before about the sound issues and each time Oliver managed to avoid it
and each time nothing good had come of it. The guy manages to disappear and
leave only Chris to deal with me and everyone else. I don&#8217;t honestly know if I
would have <em>not </em>called the cops if I had known it was Chris who was making
all the noise because he is a good and reasonable guy in general. Up until
this point Oliver was the main source of annoyance and now he had pissed off
me and Chris - who was now faced with having to pay a fine he couldn&#8217;t afford
and possible eviction if anything more happened in the future.</p>

<p>The gist of the conversation is that slow talking Chris expressed his anger at
the situation, I expressed my even greater anger, and Oliver tried to once
again avoid confrontation and leave everything on Chris. Everything about
Oliver rubs me the wrong way, from the way he dresses to the way he talks to
the kind of music he likes. It doesn&#8217;t help that I have heard from his own
mouth what a horrible person he is so seeing him avoid a situation that he
created caused me to really lose my cool in a manner that I am not proud of. I
didn&#8217;t hit him, but I was certainly on verge of doing it if he provoked me any
further.</p>

<p>He called me a &#8220;square&#8221; and flicked his cigarette at my feet.</p>

<p>I called him a &#8220;child&#8221; and a &#8220;clown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chris managed to raise his voice and show anger at Oliver for the first time.</p>

<p>The end result is that Chris agreed that Oliver was a problem and that he
would do his best to keep the noise levels down and avoid talking outside my
window as long as I agreed not to call the cops in the future.</p>

<p>If only that was the end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Introducing Chris - Oliver&#8217;s roommate and partner in noise. Chris is a 22 year
old business major who grew up in east side Portland. Apparently an area of
town known for its noise because to Chris noisy neighbors is an acceptable
part of life. Chris is roughly 6&#8217;2&#8221;, over weight, Caucasian male, smokes, and
has an ankle brace that restricts when he can legally leave the apartment. He
is commonly found wearing his favorite pair of red shorts and a blue and black
Northface fleece. He has a girlfriend who he cares very much about and who
makes a lot of money. Chris doesn&#8217;t talk like a goofy wigga like his roommate
does, instead he talks extremely slowly. Compared to Oliver, Chris is a
fucking genius. If it weren&#8217;t for the circumstances Chris would be a socially
acceptable individual.</p>

<p>Unfortunately due to his circumstances and limited mobility his favorite place
to be is smoking outside his door, directly outside my window.</p>

<p>Chris and Oliver love to talk. I used to think it was only when Chris was
smoking, but no - they talk constantly. If you are anywhere in the apartment
complex you can hear them babbling away about rap and sports and the hardships
of life. It just so happens to be the worst directly outside my window.</p>

<p>Chris&#8217;s relationship with Oliver is that of the wise, worldly elder. Chris
knows facts about every sport and just about every subject Oliver would want
to discuss.</p>

<p>Chris loves his girlfriend. Whenever something remotely scary happens in the
world Chris is immediately on the phone warning his girlfriend about the
potential of such an event occurring in Eugene and instructing her on how she
should avoid such situations. When some guy started shooting people up in an
office, he was telling his girl how to barricade herself and hide.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Chris, his lady likes to get out every now and then. Since
Chris is restricted to his home in the evening his can&#8217;t join her on these
adventures about town. During these nights I get to listen to the eventual
phone call that takes place where Chris balls his eyes out professing his love
and expounding on the hardships of his existence. This happens more times than
you would think.</p>

<p>Chris turns that table occasionally. Some nights his girlfriend want his
attention but he doesn&#8217;t want hers. On these nights his girl will pound on his
door and cry her eyes out for hours on end trying to get Chris to even
acknowledge her existence. A part of me loves these times because that means I
don&#8217;t have to have those two chatting outside my window, but then I realize
that there is a girl wailing outside my window trying to break down the
apartment door.</p>

<p>In the past my experiences with Chris have been amicable in comparison to that
of with Oliver. On one occasion did I really anger him. It was Saturday, I was
in bed being nursed back to health from a nasty bout of food poisoning, when
Chris and Oliver decided to watch the game. I couldn&#8217;t get up from bed. I
could barely take a drink of water let alone keep it in my stomach. The
slightest sound destroyed me. So when Oliver and Chris decided to have an
excited conversation about the upcoming game, my girlfriend asked them to
quiet down. Eventually they did.</p>

<p>Remember that &#8220;Woooo!&#8221;ing that Oliver was so fond of? The frequency of such
act had diminished after all the complaints the Oliver had received. Well
apparently on this day Chris decided that he was jealous of Oliver and decided
to show his excitement about the current game by doing that constantly. I had
had enough and called the cops and reported the obscene sound levels. I
mentioned the repeated annoyances that my neighbors made and that we had
repeatedly asked them to stop. A couple hours later a cop arrived and issued
Chris a $700 noise violation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The place I live currently used to be the ideal apartment. Prior to living
here a good friend of mine lived there for 2 years, so I pretty much inherited
the place when he moved out. Its located near the river bike path which gives
me easy access for runs and allows me to get to work with minimal traffic.
Additionally it has a view of the river, is a couple blocks away from a
grocery store and a is few minutes away from the joys of campus. Combined with
cheap rent it didn&#8217;t matter that the place was a dump because it was enough
for a young guy who simply needed four walls and roof to get by.</p>

<p>Aside from the occasional bum digging through the trash and the close
proximity to the railroad tracks and passing trains - the place was ideal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately 7 months ago this utopia changed. My good neighbors who I saw
maybe twice while I lived there, but never heard, decided to move out. The
very day that the new guys moved in I knew they would be trouble. It began
with what is normally a very quiet apartment complex being rocked by rap
music. Nineteen year old Oliver, a skinny, goofy looking &#8220;wigga&#8221; announced his
arrival to my quiet abode by annoying everyone who lives there. Since being my
neighbor Oliver has been fired from several jobs for reasons he doesn&#8217;t seem
to understand, and has gotten drunk and/or stoned on more occasions than I can
recount.</p>

<p>To really understand why this is a problem you need to get a feeling for the
layout of the apartment. Directly outside my door is the door to a good friend
of mine - I have known the guy for over 11 years and we work together. He used
to live where I currently live and loved the place so much that when he
returned from a trip abroad he decided to grab the unit right next to mine. We
had planned on building some kind of structure to link our doorways together
to facilitate the constant traffic between our two abodes but these plans
changed as a result of our new neighbors. Directly outside our windows is
Oliver and his roommate Chris&#8217;s front door. For whatever reason Oliver and
Chris love to talk outside their apartment, where every single word that they
utter can be heard clearly from anywhere in my apartment and most prominently
inside my room.</p>

<p>At first they were a nuisance. They would blast music with their door open. We
would counter by asking them to at least close the door if they insisted on
blasting &#8220;west coast bass&#8221; as they described it. Then they decided that it
would be OK to talk on their phones early in the morning and extremely late at
night directly outside our bedroom windows. What made this even worse is that
this happened during a time of year when our windows would normally be open so
it was like being awakened by someone talking directly into your ear.</p>

<p>You cannot understand the joys of listening to this dorky kid sweet talk a
&#8220;honey&#8221; with words like &#8220;chillass,&#8221; as in &#8220;you are a chillass girl&#8221; directly
outside your window without experiencing it for yourself.</p>

<p>One night, while he was clearly drunk, Oliver tried to sweet talk a chillass
girl by recounting how hard his life had been up until that point since he
apparently killed a girl with a car. That certainly explains why he doesn&#8217;t
drive. How inconvenient.</p>

<p>When I mentioned how annoying it was to have a guy talking outside your
bedroom window I was called a &#8220;square.&#8221; Yeah that hurt.</p>

<p>At some point during the year Oliver decided to show he excitement by
screaming &#8220;Woooo!&#8221; at the top of his lungs. This could be heard regardless of
whether his door was closed, whether he was on the other side of his apartment
or if he was directly outside my window - which is when it usually occurred. A
few months ago I thought the place would become happy again. There was a ton
of pounding on Oliver&#8217;s door and a bunch of yelling. I rushed outside ready to
see some rumbling and instead saw that a neighbor whom I had never met was
confronting Oliver. At that moment I was ecstatic. Apparently the apartment
complex was coming together to get these guys to shut up. It was awesome to
see this tiny buff dude shout out Oliver - a kid who has apparently had his
ass kicked numerous times for reasons unknown to himself. The dude was tired
of being awakened at odd hours during the night to &#8220;Wooo!&#8221;ing when he had to
get up at 4am. Finally they would understand how annoying they were to
everyone living there. Every single surrounding unit had complained to
management about Oliver&#8217;s &#8220;Wooo!&#8221;ing and management had actually threatened to
boot him out if he didn&#8217;t stop.</p>

<p>How inconvenient for a guy who is just trying to &#8220;go to school and make money&#8221;
that his neighbors are complaining.</p>
