  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have decided to get into DSLR photography. Despite being relatively new to
photography, I am constantly finding myself in situations where my Point and
Shoot camera does not cut it.</p>

<p>My Canon S3 IS has a lot going for it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Powerful Zoom and Macro ability
12-18x zoom, that can switch to a super macro mode with one button press is
very convenient and flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>Relatively Compact and Portable
While not as portable as the SD line of Canon&#8217;s, compared to a DSLR my camera
is tiny.</p></li>
<li><p>Good Manual Mode
I am able to experiment with exposure and other advanced settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Swivel LCD</p></li>
<li>Movie Mode</li>
</ul>


<p>But there are also some things that I don&#8217;t like about it that are not so much
the fault of the camera but are limitation of P&S; cameras in general, which
has lead me to considering a DSLR. These limitation are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Poor low light performance
This leads to noisy and blurry images while indoors or in less than perfect
lighting situations and forces you to take high ISO pictures. Most of the DSLR
cameras that I have looked at so far perform exceptionally even on the highest
ISO settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Slow Focus and Shutter speed
I will often miss a good shot because the camera took too long to focus and
take the shot. Compared to DSLR where you can take around 3 shots a second.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of RAW output
You can get some hacked <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">firmware</a> that
will enable RAW support as well as a lot of other cool stuff, but it takes a
long time to save a picture and the format isn&#8217;t standard.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The main factor holding me back from buying a DSLR has always been the price.
For a while it has been considerably more expensive to buy a DSLR versus a
pro-sumer P&amp;S.; I considered it a huge investment that I was not willing to
make. What made me consider getting a DSLR is that there are now several high
quality DSLRs that can be found for the price of a newer P&amp;S.; I paid around
$350 for my S3 IS about a year ago. Today a Nikon or Canon entry level DSLR
can be found for around $450, which is just in my price range.</p>

<p>The hardest part about buying a DSLR is selecting what brand to buy into. It
isn&#8217;t just about buying a camera. It is also about investing in the brand&#8217;s
lenses, which will most likely outlive the camera long after the camera has
become technically obsolete. My choices have come down to either a Canon or
Nikon, based mostly on the fact that these are the most popular brands for
professionals and enthusiasts. Canon is by far the most popular brand among
professional photographers, while Nikon offers comparable image quality while
being more newbie friendly.</p>

<p>My main resource for research has been the forums over at
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com">dpreview</a>. In addition to great reviews found on the
main site, the forums are very active and friendly to beginners.</p>

<p>While studying photography I have come to respect the work of <a href="http://http://www.kenrockwell.com/">Ken
Rockwell</a>. If there is anything negative
to say about Ken, it is that he is overly bias towards Nikons. With that said,
Ken <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/recommended-cameras.htm">recommends</a> the
Nikon D40 over many more costly cameras. Based on his advice what I gleaned
from the dpreview forums, I am 90% certain I will be getting a Nikon D40.</p>

<p>I can get a D40 today for around $470-$500, brand new, or $400 refurbished. It
comes with a kit 15-55mm lens that everyone considers to be really good. The
camera feels great in my hands and I love the build quality. My S3 IS and
Canon DSLRs that I have seen at stores feel like toys in comparison. Rockwell
constantly talks about how its a good idea to get a low cost body and spend
you money instead of quality lenses. This has tempted me to buy a refurbished
D40, but I am hesitant because for an extra $50-100 I can get the
manufacturer&#8217;s warranty.</p>

<p>The kit lens that comes with entry level DSLRs is equivalent to about 3x zoom,
which is far less than I am used to working with. Additionally, Nikon and
Canon decided to put Image Stabilization (or Vibration Reduction) in the
lenses and not the body like I am used to. I tend to use IS as a crutch and
have become dependent on it, so my first lens purchases will be to get a lens
that has some form of IS. With Nikon, VR lenses are relatively cheap. The
closest for Canon is much more costly. Additionally Nikon has a few really
flexible lenses that are popular and inexpensive, in particular I have my eye
on the <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/18200.htm">18-200mm VR</a> that Ken
adores so much. Canon on the other hand has a much greater variety of lenses
that can be used with its cameras.</p>

<p>There are two issues with the d40. The first is that the body alone can&#8217;t auto
focus. Instead it relies on special lenses that can AF for it. This greatly
limits what lenses it can use AF with, so many older lenses will not be
compatible. The newer D60 has the same issue, but the more expensive (about
$300 more) D80 does not though. The second issue is that it is &#8220;only&#8221; 6
MegaPixels. For some this may be an issue. Both the D60 and D80 have around 10
MP. Something Ken points out though is that they use a very similar sensor, so
the image quality between the three cameras does not improve with the greater
MP count.</p>

<p>The D60 just came out, the main selling point for me is that the included kit
lens comes with VR. The lens alone costs about $200, and the D60 with the kit
lens is about $250 more than the D40 kit. I am not sure its worth it to me to
try and buy the lens by itself though as I would be paying $200 for VR alone
over the D40, which I would rather just save an invest towards a different
lens.</p>

<p>Another thing that complicates the matter is that Canon is releasing a new
camera in a month or two called the XSi, or 450D. It is the replacement for
Canon&#8217;s incredibly popular XTi. As far as entry level DSLRs go this camera has
all the bells and whistles I would want in a camera. Bigger, brighter screen
that also supports Live View - a feature I am used to with P&S;, and that can
normally only be found on high end DSLRs. Additionally it has the highest MP
of all the entry level DSLRs. The D80 is considered the XSi&#8217;s primary
competition and will actually only be $50 cheaper than the XSi&#8217;s MSRP of $899,
which is still quite a bit more than I comfortable spending on a camera.</p>

<p>While the XSi is very attractive its existence is more important to me because
it will hopefully drive down the prices of other cameras. So while I am
relatively certain that I will be getting a Nikon D40 as my first DSLR, I am
going to try and wait for the XSi to come out and keep an eye out for better
deals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past year and a half a buddy of mine has loaned me some space to host
this blog. While this was a good starting point it did have a lot of
limitations. So I finally caved and found a host that offered a good balance
between space, bandwidth, privileges and cost.</p>

<p>I get unlimited domains, databases, email accounts etc. The only limitation is
space and bandwidth. All for about $30 a <em>year</em>.</p>

<p>I also took the opportunity to transfer my blog&#8217;s database and update to the
latest version of wordpress. I am not entirely happy with this theme but it is
good enough for now.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will be able to use this new host to experiment with some projects
in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got my car back from the shop today.</p>

<p>Thanks to the wildness that is insurance I actually <em>profited</em> from this whole
experience.</p>

<p>Yes, I never got my racquets back and had to drop some cash to replace some of
the gear that I lost. It took a while to even get my racquets reported on the
police report and I have no idea if anything will ever result from it. But I
was looking for an excuse to get a new tennis bag, and now I have one. It was
depressing having to buy the same exact shoes again that I bought around a
week earlier as well as another racquet.</p>

<p>The guys at Les Schwab were freaken awesome. Particularly the mechanic who was
helping me since day one. That shitty towing service ended up screwing up the
car&#8217;s frame and the front axle while towing. When the insurance guy came to
evaluate the damages my mechanic was able to point out that the damage
definitely didn&#8217;t exist prior to the theft and was able to outline all the
repairs and parts that were needed to get me back in order. When it came time
for the guy to write a check it more than covered my needs.</p>

<p>The under-damage couldn&#8217;t be done at the tire shop, so I worked out an off the
books deal with my mechanic to get it all straighted out and have my radiator
and everything else that was hanging loose bolted down. Then he cleaned up the
car and got my stereo working again. So when all was said and done he was able
to repair all the damage and replace the wheels at much less than what the
insurance guy quoted.</p>

<p>The thieves really did a number to my car alarm (which I never used :/). The
alarm probably went off when they were fucking around with the engine (they
stole the oil cap) so the thieves stole my alarm fob, probably trying to turn
the thing off. The car&#8217;s battery was drained by the time the cops found it
because the alarm was constantly going. Once my mechanic had the battery
charged up the alarm blared with no way to turn it off. So my mechanic had to
disable the alarm manually. After I got the car back the first thing I did was
take it to an audio shop and had the alarm disabled. I may look into getting
another alarm system installed, the one the shop offered was $200 though.</p>

<p>I really missed driving the little thing after spending a bit of time driving
that middle-aged-lady-mobile. I missed being able to zip around and not
feeling like I was going to run pedestrians over who were along the side of
the street. Insurance is going to refund my towing bill (around $500) and pay
for the rental so it will be nice getting that money back.</p>

<p>All that is left now is to fill out some insurance paper work that needs to be
notarized at a bank and then I can put this all behind me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up yesterday dreading the day. For whatever reason I didn&#8217;t feel like
going to work or getting a workout. So I spent the morning reading the news,
drinking coffee and basically doing anything but going to work. Finally at
9:50am, about an hour later that I usually decide to go to work, I left my
apartment. Keys in hand something wasn&#8217;t right&#8230; my car wasn&#8217;t where it
should be. At first I figured I was just confused because my girlfriend parked
where I usually park. Nope - still no car. Without a doubt the shittiest car
on the block had been stolen, and I was the victim.</p>

<p>My first emotion was confusion. Yeah I drive a Civic which is one of the most
commonly stolen vehicles. But I also drive a shitty Civic especially compared
to my girlfriend&#8217;s one parked right next to it. I checked with my neighbor who
was up late playing games rather than sleeping. He heard my car around 5am
that morning, and just figured I was getting an early start. I then reported
it to the cops. When an officer finally arrived she informed me that there
were a string of car thefts in the area. Moments later a patrol car went by
looking for a different stolen car.</p>

<p>As the officer was leaving she told me &#8220;hope you have a better day!&#8221; That is a
saying I had never heard before, but appreciated. I had my girlfriend drive me
to work after I filed the report. I didn&#8217;t expect to ever see the car again
because I figured car thefts were like bike thefts in Eugene where it was
common enough and given the amount of time the car was in another state by
now. The officer though informed me that there was a 0.5% chance that they
wouldn&#8217;t find the car within 10 days. I called my insurance to make sure that
I was covered for theft and then tried to get some work done.</p>

<p>The car isn&#8217;t a big deal to me. Its cheap and covered under insurance. What
wasn&#8217;t though was about $500 worth of racquets and new tennis shoes that I had
in the back. That unfortunately would not be covered by my insurance. I had in
total 3 racquets in the car. Two were old, but still worth about ~100 each.
The third I got last month and cost me around ~200. The shoes I got at the
same time and were around ~115. The night before I had contemplated storing my
2nd new racquet in my car since the strings were just about done on my other
new racquet, but thankfully I did not.</p>

<p>Around 3pm I got a call from the officer telling me that they found my car. It
was found in a garage some place on blocks with its wheels gone. It was being
towed now by some strangely named towing company. My first question was
whether my gear was in the back of the car or not - she didn&#8217;t know. My
insurance agent throughout this whole ordeal has been helpful in informing me
what I was entitled to and hooking me up with a rental car until the my car
was either found or repaired.</p>

<p>The towing company refused to tow it to a tire repair place that night. They
claimed it was traffic related but I think that is bullshit. In order to get
them to release the car I would have to pay them for the initial tow job from
the &#8220;garage&#8221; and then pay them again to get it towed to a Les Schwab. Ok fine,
how bad could it be? Insurance said they would cover it so whatever. They
wanted $437, and they wanted cash. Additionally they wanted another $65 to tow
it to Les Schwab.</p>

<p>After work I got the cash from the bank and picked up my newly rented Dodge
Charger (girlfriend calls it an old man car, I call it a white woman car). I
found my way to the shadiest looking tow trunk company I have ever seen to see
what kind of damage was done to my car and to pay for the tow job. To assist
me in finding my car the guy who ran the place called upon the aid of a guy
they called &#8220;little man.&#8221; The name suited him perfectly, he was practically a
midget and even had a name tag on that said &#8220;umpa lumpa.&#8221; When we were heading
towards it Little Man pointed it out to me, I didn&#8217;t recognize it without
wheels. The impact of having my car stolen didn&#8217;t really hit me until the
moment I saw it sitting on blocks. Up until that moment I still had some hope
that my gear was still in the back. Nope&#8230; it was gone. Almost everything
else (like registration and insurance card) was still there. Everything except
what I wanted most to be there.</p>

<p>They actually used my jack and tire iron to get the wheels off. Thankfully
they didn&#8217;t damage the engine or take the stereo (which never really worked).
They did take my pride though.</p>

<p>When I got back to the office, obviously pissed the guy asked me how bad it
was. Little Man answered for me &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night I wasn&#8217;t happy. I was angry that there wasn&#8217;t anything I could have
done to prevent the theft and not really anything other than buying an alarm
system which would probably cost more than the car is worth to prevent future
theft. My door was locked, I distinctly remember checking it last night, and
there was no windows broken. I ended up waking up in the middle of the night
and not getting back to sleep until 7am. Which is about the time I was
supposed to call Les Schwab in the morning to inform them to expect the car.
Thankfully at 9am I remembered what I was supposed to do - call Les Schwab and
make sure they have room for my car.</p>

<p>The guys at Les Schwab immediately sounded less creepy than the guys at that
towing place did. They informed me that they could keep the car there until
Monday (when my insurance agent gets back in). And they told me what kind of
damage was done to the car. Aside from the 4 missing tires there was also some
damage done to the front frame area and to the front axle. I asked what could
have caused that sort of damage and he replied with what I suspected - most
likely it happened when the car was towed. So not only did those guys charge
me ~$500, they caused even more damage to my car than the thieves probably
did. It is entirely possible that the gentleman who stole my car caused the
damage, I will find out on Monday.</p>

<p>At this point I am hoping that my insurance covers all the repairs and
replacement of the tires and whatever else that needs to be done to get the
car in driving order. My deductible is $500 so assuming I don&#8217;t have to pay
anymore for the car then I am out around $1000 counting the stolen tennis
gear. I still have some hope that the cops found my tennis gear and just
neglected to mention it when they were telling me about the car.</p>

<p>TGIF right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This has been one of the best years in gaming. Not since 1998 has there been
such an all round great year. In 1998 gamers saw the releases of Half-Life,
Starcraft, Tribes, Baldur&#8217;s Gate, Unreal, and Thief: The Dark Project. All
games which strongly inspired some of the top games released this year.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t going to be a top 10 list. This is going to be a general review of
games that stood out for me this year.</p>

<p>There was a whole lot of games that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to play, and not all
the games that I did play did I get to finish. But what I did get to play was
extremely entertaining.</p>

<p>I have long considered myself to be a PC gamer. Back when the other kids had
their super nintendos and segas I had my PC. Even when everyone moved on to
the playstation 2 and the original xbox, I was a die hard PC gamer. Despite
the large quantity of quality games on those consoles and I didn&#8217;t get to play
any of them until long after their respective systems had gone out of style.
This year though was strange in that I had a PC that was capable of playing
every game that came out and also had both <em>next-gen </em>consoles. So the <em>depth</em>
of gaming that I had this year is staggering.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think I have a game of the year. I do have some stand outs
that I will be playing and thinking about long into the next year.</p>

<h2>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/646436b.jpg/256px-%0A646436b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Towards the end of last year I really got back into WoW. I hadn&#8217;t played the
game in a while but got back briefly to beta test the expansion. It was enough
to give a general idea what to expect when the expansion officially came out.</p>

<p>Out of everything I played this year though this probably ate up the most of
my time. I have yet to go on a <em>raid</em> in the expansion beyond instances, and
building on my experience in the beta I got to level 70 relatively fast.</p>

<p>Once that happened though my interest in the game quickly waned. I picked it
up a bit a couple months ago as a harmless distraction, but that didn&#8217;t last
very long. For now I am basically <em>done</em> with WoW. But it was nice to see how
much Blizzard has <em>perfected</em> the style of MMO that gamers first glimpsed in
Everquest back when it was first shown in 1998.</p>

<h2>God of War 2</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/Gow2-2.jpg/260px-%0AGow2-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>My ex-roommate got into gaming because of the original God of War. He went
from despising gaming to playing through GoW several times. I have yet to beat
either but I can appreciate it. GoW2 is considered to be one of the last great
games of that generation. The PS2 has seen some other noteworthy titles this
year but GoW2 is outstanding enough that it could have easily been considered
a <em>next-gen</em> title.</p>

<p>The graphics of GoW2 compared to a lot of the other titles coming out for the
newer titles were outstanding. It easily looked better than anything on the
PS3 at the time. This was the first title that I was really hyped for. Enough
for me to want to go out and buy a PS2 to play it. I ended up not buying one
though and got a PS3 instead so that I would have access to future titles.</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy 12</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Ffxiicase.jpg/255px-%0AFfxiicase.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is one of the first games that I picked up for my PS3. Sure it came out
towards the end of 2006 but its fantastic. It plays out like a single player
MMO. I have yet to finish it though as I easily got distracted by other games.
But it did make me hungry for what Square Enix has in store for their next
Final Fantasy game. The graphics are amazing for what it is, but still it is
noticeably dated despite the PS3&#8217;s ability to upscale emulated games.</p>

<h2>Shadow of the Colossus</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/Sotc_boxart.jpg/256px-%0ASotc_boxart.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is another title that I got when I picked up my PS3. This game made me
say <em>Holy Shit</em> quite a few times. The scale and graphics are amazing. The
developer managed to push the system like nothing else. It is such a beautiful
game, both to watch and play.</p>

<p>It is such a simple game - you ride around, find a giant, climb up it, and
kill it. Rinse and Repeat. But the way that it is executed blew me away.</p>

<p>The fact that developer <em>Team Ico</em> is signed on to exclusively make games for
the PS3 is almost reason enough to own the system.</p>

<h2>Katarmari Damacy</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/aa/KatamariDamacybox.jpg%0A/250px-KatamariDamacybox.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yeah this game is <em>old.</em> As in it came out in 2004. But since I was catching
up on must play titles from the PS2 I couldn&#8217;t pass this game up. To sum it up
- this game is joy. The art is of course very basic and blocky but it is built
on such a fun concept. The music was absolutely perfect and along with the
quirky style and humor really made it a stand out game for me.</p>

<h2>Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection Online</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cc/Tekken5dr.jpg/280px-%0ATekken5dr.jpg" alt="" /> Aka the game with the ever expanding title.</p>

<p>My friends and I love fighting games. Between Tekken and Soul Calibur, there
is a whole lot of fun to be had. Tekken 5 DR is based on the PSP port of the
PS2 game. Yep it started out as a PS2 game, then was ported to the PSP and
then finally to the PS3. Initially I got this game so that I could finally get
up to speed with Tekken 5 and play against my buddies. So imagine my surprise
when I found a game that had <em>less </em>features than if I had just gone out and
bought the PS2 version. It didn&#8217;t have the training feature of the original
which made it worthless to me.</p>

<p>Months after its release though it received an upgrade (which you had to pay
more for) that included the training mode and additionally an online mode.
This update alone sold the PS3 to my friends. It isn&#8217;t perfect but when its
smooth it is amazing. Being able to play against people throughout the world
and finding out just how good you are is incredible.</p>

<p>I will be playing this a lot right up until Tekken 6 comes out.</p>

<p>This is also the first title that I have purchased from a console using the
playstation network. It was a painless experience and is the future of game
distribution.</p>

<h2>Heavenly Sword</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/HS.PS3.jpg/256px-%0AHS.PS3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the first <em>next-gen</em> title that I really played on my PS3. I played
Motorstorm and Virtua Fighter 5 earlier in the year but neither of those
really stood out to me. Heavenly Sword is the first example of a title that
really demonstrated gameplay that wasn&#8217;t really possible in previous console
generations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was a big let down for me. The cut-scenes were top notch and
parts of the game was a lot of fun, but there were so many other, better games
that came out this year that greatly over shadowed this.</p>

<h2>Bioshock</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d7/Bioshockcoverfinalcrop%0Aped.jpg/256px-Bioshockcoverfinalcropped.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was a huge fan of System Shock 2. It is one of those games that I never
finished but still look back on fondly. So when I heard that Ken Levine was
making a new game that would set to be the spiritual successor of SS2, I got
excited. At first I thought the publisher was doing the game a great
disservice. SS2 was critically acclaimed but sold horribly. So the publisher
tried to avoid repeating history by selling BioShock as a shooter, when it is
so much more. Additionally they weren&#8217;t really marketing it much at all.</p>

<p>When it finally came out though everyone took notice. The style, themes,
graphics, sound and gameplay clicked with a lot of people. All around it is
one of the top games to come out this year and thankfully has sold remarkably
well.</p>

<h2>The Orange Box</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Hltob-win-cover.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Talk about value. This is the only title that I pre-ordered this year and it
was worth every penny. Half-life was one of the games that made 1998 so good
and the Orange Box is without a doubt one of the titles that make 2007 so
good.</p>

<p>Episode 2 is refined greatness. Valve is an amazing studio and HL2 is one of
the greatest games ever made. Through Episodes 1 and 2 (both included in the
Orange Box) they have refined what was in HL2 and created games that are tight
and well paced. Despite its age the Source engine is looking fantastic.</p>

<p>Team Fortress, which started out as a mod of one of my favorite games of all
time over 10 years ago got one of the most amazing updates ever in the form of
Team Fortress 2. Rather than create a whole new game the guys at Valve took
the basic goodness that made up TF and polished and tweaked it in a way that
really makes it one of the stand out multiplayer games of 2007. The art style
alone is probably the greatest ever made, but on top of that the game is loads
of fun.</p>

<p>Portal began as a student project and ended as probably the greatest surprise
of 2007. With TF2 and HL2 Ep2 Valve has already delivered arguable the best
single player and multi player games of 2007. So myself and probably everyone
else saw Portal as a happy bonus. Imagine my surprise when I found 3 hours of
one of the most <em>perfect</em> games ever made. It isn&#8217;t only a puzzle game with
slick graphics. It is a <em>polished</em> game with some of the best writing, sound
effects and music ever put in a game.</p>

<p>While it is unfair to call the Orange Box the game of the year because it is
made up of several different games, it is without a doubt the best gaming
packing to come out this year. Every gamer owes it to themselves to go out and
buy it.</p>

<h2>Halo 3</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Halo_3_final_boxshot.J%0APG/256px-Halo_3_final_boxshot.JPG" alt="" /> Halo 3 is easily the most hyped game of the
year. It is the number 1 reason why I purchased a 360 and the only game I have
<em>ever </em>waited in line for. Some of my friends got in line hours before mid-
night to get their hands on a copy. I went 30 minutes before it went on sale
at Wal-mart and still had to wait in line. The next day they had stacks of
boxes at Cost-Co of all places.</p>

<p>It is a good game that has way above average multi player that will no doubt
be played for years to come. It isn&#8217;t the best game to come out this year but
it is the best coop game to come out in a long time. It has really set the bar
for console based multi player match making. Unfortunately it is unlikely any
studio is going to be willing to put as much love into multi player as Bungie
has in the future.</p>

<h2>Warhawk</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Ps3warhawkbox.jpg%0A/256px-Ps3warhawkbox.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When all the kids were clamoring for Halo 3 multi player I couldn&#8217;t help but
think about a multi player only title that came out a month earlier for the
PS3. I ended up buying this game on PSN to play with a buddy at work. It is
actually a whole lot of fun. At first I was turned off by the weird running
animations and wrote this game off as being a Battlefield-lite game. But what
I found was a top-notch multi player experience that was much more
entertaining than Halo 3 or Unreal Tournament 3. It is in my top 5 multi
player games this year.</p>

<h2>Hellgate: London</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Hellgate_London.jpg%0A/255px-Hellgate_London.jpg" alt="" /> This is probably the greatest disappointment for
me this year. Created by the guys who did the outrageously popular Diablo 2,
and loaded with hype, this game should have been amazing. I never got passed
the demo though. The art direction, user-interface, and game-play were all
incredibly below the standards of the game&#8217;s pedigree. What should have been
one of the top games of the year was instead a buggy and uninspiring mess.</p>

<h2>Guitar Hero 3</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Guitar-hero-iii-cover-%0Aimage.jpg" alt="" /> I hadn&#8217;t planned on getting this game, but when the release came I
bought it on impulse. I had always enjoyed Guitar Hero, but never owned it. So
I was able to justify the purchase in the game because I would be investing in
future GH games.</p>

<p>GH3 is done by a new developer who was able to faithfully recreate the game
play of previous GH games. The set list though, while nice that they were able
to use the actual songs, wasn&#8217;t nearly as entertaining as previous titles. I
haven&#8217;t touched this game as much as I had hoped to, it still seems more like
work than fun for me to get better at this game.</p>

<p>Also it ended up being greatly out shadowed by Rock Band. Drums turned out to
be much more enjoyable for me. RB also has a much better song list and more
importantly is a better party game.</p>

<p>It nice to have and occasionally I play it but I consider this to be the worst
gaming related purchase this year.</p>

<h2>R4DS</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.r4ndsl.com/product/images/p2.jpg" alt="" /> There aren&#8217;t any DS related
games on this list. This isn&#8217;t because there weren&#8217;t a shit ton of good titles
released on that platform this year, it is because once I got an R4DS I never
saw the DS again. My girlfriend has claimed the DS as her own and plays it
just about every day which leaves me zero opportunity to play it myself.</p>

<p>The ~$40 I paid for the R4DS has produced an incredible amount of value and is
the best gaming related purchase I have made this year.</p>

<h2>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.joystiq.com/media/2007/04/pf2t_live.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>An updated version of an old title. I got this off the PSN for the PS3 and had
a ton of fun with my girlfriend. One of the best <em>casual</em> games that I
purchased this year.</p>

<h2>Crysis</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Crysis_Boxart_Final.jp%0Ag/256px-Crysis_Boxart_Final.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Crysis is to the industry today what Unreal was back in 1998. While it wasn&#8217;t
the most fun game to come out it was without the biggest graphical powerhouse.
It was one of the few games out this year that really compelled me to finish
it. This is also the only game to come out this year that made me feel like my
computer was from 1998. I could barely play the game, which is more than most
gamers could say this year. What should been considered one of the better
games to come out this year has sold under 50,000 copies. This is at a time
when games are expected to sell in the millions to be considered successful.</p>

<p>It was a fun game, even if the gameplay was only marginally different from
FarCry. So is Crysis a success? Technically and as a game it shines very
brightly, and will be the graphical standard for quite a while.</p>

<h2>Ratchet and Clank: Tools of Destruction</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/R%26C_FTD_Box_Art-RP-%0Athumb.jpg/256px-R%26C_FTD_Box_Art-RP-thumb.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One of the casualties for me of not owning a Playstation 2 is that I never got
to play the other games in the Ratchet and Clank series. This game has a whole
lot going for it and is the best platformer that I played this year.</p>

<p>Visually it is one of the better looking games to come out this year and is
probably the first title that could make 360 only owners envious. It is a fun
game and I consider it probably the first <em>must have</em> title for the PS3.</p>

<h2>Mass Effect</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ce/Masseffect.jpg/256px-%0AMasseffect.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One of my early favorites for game of the year, before I had even played it.
This game was done by the company that brought us Buldar&#8217;s Gate on the engine
done by the guys who did Unreal. Sporting a serious dialog system that made
character conversations as compelling as everything else in the game, which is
a huge improvement over most games of this type where I find myself skipping
through dialog or not paying attention.</p>

<p>The main complaint people have is of the combat, which they find lacking, but
I found it entertaining. Bioware has built a universe and filled it with
strong, compelling characters that is comparable to the Starwars universe. I
haven&#8217;t even finished it yet and I am hurting for the sequel.</p>

<h2>Uncharted</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/Uncharted.jpg/256px-%0AUncharted.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have yet to scratch the surface of this game but I can already tell that
this is one of the better games to come out this year. It is a combination of
Prince of Persia, Tomb Raider and Gears of War. So far it has been critically
acclaimed, but like Ratchet and Clank hasn&#8217;t sold exceptionally well but it
does show the immense potential of the PS3 in the years to come.</p>

<h2>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/Assassin%27s_Creed.jpg%0A/256px-Assassin%27s_Creed.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is another game I figured would be a huge contender for game of the year,
unfortunately though it wasn&#8217;t at all what I thought it would be. What I hoped
it would be as a combination of Thief, with the dexterity of Prince of Persia
put in an open world like Oblivion or GTA 3. What I got was a lot of similar
elements in a game that doesn&#8217;t feel complete. They created this beautiful,
open ended world and didn&#8217;t really give you much to do. I am a couple missions
from completing this game and find climbing buildings to be exceptional but
every other aspect of it to be lackluster.</p>

<p>It would have been so much more fun to be able to stealthy sneak around a huge
world - stealing and assassinating. Instead the game promotes attacking your
targets head on and the only thing you can steal are throwing knives. In many
ways Thief back in 1998 was a superior game. Hopefully in the sequel the
developers will take their time and make the game they should have made in the
first place.</p>

<h2>Call of Duty 4</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Callofduty4mwfcov.jpg%0A/256px-Callofduty4mwfcov.jpg" alt="" /> Easily the <em>smartest</em> title to come out this
year. Infinity Ward accomplished what every other developer has struggled to
do this year. They created a stunning looking game that runs great on just
about every platform. The game is indentical and runs flawlessly on the PC,
360 and PS3. As a result they are selling nearly as many titles as Halo 3.</p>

<p>The single player provides some of the greatest moments I have ever had in a
FPS, but so far its the multi-player that is really gripping me. It is
probably the first FPS on a console to capture the feel of Counter Strike,
which I consider a good thing. Additionally they made it so its like an MMO
where people feel compelled to play to <em>level up</em> and get perks and weapons.
Almost 20 hours into it and I am still having fun.</p>

<h2>Wii Tennis and Virtua Tennis 3</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/Virtuatennis3front-1-.%0Ajpg/260px-Virtuatennis3front-1-.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Tennis games are the only sports games that I can stand to play. Virtua Tennis
3 is remarkable because it scratched an itch I have had since the very first
Virtua Tennis, which has been soothed over the years with VT 2k2 and the Top
Spin series. VT3 doesn&#8217;t quite capture the feel of tennis as well as Top Spin
does but it is still the best tennis game to come out this year. That is
unless you consider Wii Tennis in that category.</p>

<p>Since the day we got a Wii in the office, myself and a group of guys have met
at Wii O&#8217; Clock (5pmish) to play Wii Tennis. We have taken the game to a level
that I don&#8217;t think anyone else in the world has. Sure the Wii didn&#8217;t come out
this year but the system is still hard to find this holiday as it was last.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t quite the same as tennis. Beginners try to swing away like they are
holding a racquet but when you have played as long as we have then you will
eventually learn to take small, short twitches. I can&#8217;t imagine another title
coming out for any system that will hold our attention every day like Wii
Tennis does. Next year I am looking forward to Top Spin 3.</p>

<p>There were obviously a lot of titles that I didn&#8217;t get to play this year, but
the ones I mentioned represent how good gaming is today. There are some
excellent titles coming out next year, and if they some how manage to some how
beat this year then gamers everywhere will be the winners.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got back into town Tuesday evening after spending a week on Oahu. I managed
to do almost everything I wanted to do with a few exceptions.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I could have picked a worse time to go on vacation. My buddy
Brett decided to come along with me and we were both exceptionally busy at
work. Thankfully we were able to accomplish much of what we needed to do
remotely, which meant putting in 4ish hours a day of work while we are
supposed to be on vacation. I can&#8217;t recommend pdanet enough. I have written
about it before, but on this trip we really took advantage of it. I am all
about disconnecting every now and then, but if you need a connection anywhere
then this thing more than pays for itself. Having access to a connected laptop
definitely made the trip more enjoyable than it would have been otherwise.</p>

<p>The week before we got there the island had a serious wind storm that left a
lot of wreckage and toppled over trees. Thankfully the weather was nearly
perfect while we were there. It wasn&#8217;t so hot that we got toasted while we
swam and the wind was enough that the heat wasn&#8217;t unbearable.</p>

<p>We spent the first few days at my mom&#8217;s place in Wahiawa near the North Shore.
I hadn&#8217;t seen my mom in nearly 3 years so it was nice catching up with her and
other family. I have a whole lot of family spread out through the island. A
lot of it isn&#8217;t &#8220;real&#8221; family. Much of current Hawaiian culture is a
reflection of the original Hawaiian beliefs, particularly that of communal
family. So even if someone isn&#8217;t related by blood, the community sees them as
family. So in short I have more uncles and aunties and cousins that I can
count. Chances are that if I meet someone who has lived on the island their
whole life, that they know someone I know or is some how related to me.</p>

<p>First thing I noticed again before I even got to the island is why they call
this place the rainbow state. There were tons of rainbows. On the flight over
saw some beautiful &#8220;circular&#8221; rainbows, as well as rainbows under small
patches of clouds that had gentle showers. On one of our first drives we
caught site of a nice rainbow where you could see the ending of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5143%0A337645222411426"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/zacharyz/R2DOVndgPKI/AAAAAAAAA7w/ZaMWYrmRv-M/s400/I%0AMG_2325.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>We visited this little island/bird refuge that a couple uncles maintain. It
was very beautiful and loaded with koi. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.%0Acom/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5143340896512654818"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/zacharyz/R2%0ADRS3dgPeI/AAAAAAAAA-0/EnPHJBqyWZg/s400/IMG_2391.JPG" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://%0Apicasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5143343718306168610"><img src="http://lh5.googl%0Ae.com/zacharyz/R2DT3HdgPyI/AAAAAAAABB0/MJT5mDpO08k/s400/IMG_2501.JPG" alt="" /></a> We
wanted to do some scuba diving, but the package the local place offered in
Haleiwa was for 8 hours a day, for 3 days at around $400. I didn&#8217;t want to
spend my whole vacation learning to scuba dive so we opted for snorkeling gear
instead. We went to a local beach first where we caught site of some para-
surfers. I have no idea if that is what they are officially called. Its not
quite wind surfing. They have these huge kites that pull them along very fast.
It was quite the sight seeing seven all in one area and not colliding into
each other.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5143%0A346235157004354"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/zacharyz/R2DWJndgQEI/AAAAAAAABEk/AGAbQDJQq8g/s400/I%0AMG_2582.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The next day we decided we wanted better so we went over to Hanauma Bay. This
place is a huge attraction for tourists as it is filled with fish. Growing up
I remember there being so much fish here that you could see schools of them in
waves. Now though there isn&#8217;t so much and all the coral is brown. Thanks
Global Warming! Additionally when we got here they charge you $5 and make you
watch a 9 minute long video about the place. Basically they pull in over a
million visitors a year, all at $5 a pop, so the place pays for itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5143%0A650413330841890"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/R2HqzHdgQSI/AAAAAAAABHc/8U0yQJMMYlI/s400/I%0AMG_2604.JPG" alt="" /></a> I managed to snorkel most of it. Much of it consisted of me
skimming along the shallower parts of it. There wasn&#8217;t a whole lot to see but
it was still fun. It was filled with fat tourists who I ended up calling
&#8220;whales&#8221; who some how managed to find ways to bump into me regardless of how
remote I was from everyone else.</p>

<p>On Friday we checked into our room at the Hilton. My mom works there so we
were able to get a great deal on a room. What would usually cost $300 a night
ended up costing $80 for us. The room overlooked an unopened and very pretty
looking lagoon. Being able to go down to the beach and hop into 77 degree
water was very relaxing.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5144%0A114495368794962"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/zacharyz/R2OQ4PxlE1I/AAAAAAAABII/Ve6qB2xJ2Tc/s400/I%0AMG_2625.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5144%0A390764845143170"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/R2SMJPxlFII/AAAAAAAABMI/pO4DjX61Mes/s400/I%0AMG_2675.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5144%0A122093165941714"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/R2OXyfxlE9I/AAAAAAAABJU/c3C1Mb5DJgM/s400/I%0AMG_2652.JPG" alt="" /></a> One of my goals was to have some <em>real</em> ramen while I was
here. Eugene has Toshi&#8217;s Ramen, which is good but there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of
variety. So i set out to find <em>good</em> ramen while I was in Waikiki. The first
place, the probably the most recommend that I was able to find was Tenkaippin.
This place is known around the island and by tourists as one of the best ramen
places on the island. It was spendy (ended up costing $17 for my meal) but
very satisfying. It tasted amazing and the gyoza in particular was probably
the best I have had in over 10 years.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5144%0A396434201973970"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/R2SRTPxlFNI/AAAAAAAABM4/7KaY6SH4sEM/s400/I%0AMG_2690.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The next day I checked out a place called Ramen Nakamura which unfortunately
wasn&#8217;t nearly as good. I ordered yakisoba (fried noodles) which was marginally
better than what I can get locally and the gyoza was horrible and almost under
cooked. I ended up returning to Tenkaippin on the last day I was there and got
some of their kottori ramen, which is what they are famous for. It was easily
the thickest ramen I have ever had. Very delicious.</p>

<p>Brett and I really wanted to do some hiking on our vacation. Basically go some
place no one else does and get lost. We rented some mopeds (a new experience
for me) and went off to Diamond Head crater. While not quite remote, it was a
fast hike and a great view.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5145%0A772129406752546"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/zacharyz/R2l0fPxlFyI/AAAAAAAABT4/0YRQcf81fl0/s400/I%0AMG_2746.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>On the way down I managed to slip on a rock and dislocate my pinky when I
braced myself against a rock wall. At first I thought it was broken, but when
it went back into place without having to manually set it. It was pretty
shocking to see my finger at such an odd and extreme angle, thankfully nothing
was seriously damaged and there was only minor swelling.</p>

<p>Since we had the mopeds for the rest of the day we wanted to try and get a
better hike in. We saw this little squiggle on a map we got from the hotel and
headed off in the general direction to find it. We ended up going up several
hills and found this little path that was easy to miss. I didn&#8217;t get the name
but it was the start to a pretty serious hike.</p>

<p>Much of the hike consisted of rocking along the top of a ridge. Combined with
the wind and the extreme angle of the path it got scary at times, as a misstep
could have lead to a sprained ankle or long fall down.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5145%0A770596103427778"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/R2lzF_xlFsI/AAAAAAAABS8/rl0l4VM4VEc/s400/I%0AMG_2763.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t an easy hike, and turned out to be a lot longer than we thought it
was going to be. Eventually the path died off and got way to muddy to proceed.
But the view and experience was amazing. People who have done Diamond Head
talk about how happy they are that they did it for the view, but compared to
how high we were, Diamond Head was tiny. <a href="http://picasaweb.google%0A.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5145769668390491714"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/R%0A2lyP_xlFkI/AAAAAAAABRw/JAsCkglyos4/s400/IMG_2785.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In the end it felt like we got to explore a part of the island that most
tourists don&#8217;t get to see.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zacharyz/VacationBackHome/photo#5145%0A753484953720162"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/zacharyz/R2ljh_xlFWI/AAAAAAAABOk/-wzLT_QzkqA/s400/I%0AMG_2808.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>On the last day I got to learn how to surf. I did it enough to know that I
wish I had started sooner as it was a lot of fun, next time I am on the island
I will do spend more time doing it. We rented some boards in Waikiki which was
loaded with tourists learning how to surf as well, so we didn&#8217;t seem out of
place not knowing what we were doing.</p>

<p>Overall the trip was a lot of fun. I got to see lots of family, relax and read
a good book, experiment with some new photography techniques, explore some
interesting places, learn some new things, and enjoy some good food. I didn&#8217;t
get to play any tennis while I was there which was surprising, and there are
still some other places I would have liked to hike to and explore, but I still
felt like I accomplished a lot on the trip.</p>

<p>I took a shit load of photos, many of which I uploaded every night. This was
the first trip that I have had where I had access to an ipod (great for
getting lost and wandering around), a good camera, laptop and a cellphone with
google maps. The next trip I go on I want some form of GPS. If not in the next
phone I get then hopefully a standalone unit. Google maps helped a lot but it
would have been nice to have something more accurate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since my last post a whole lot has happened and I haven&#8217;t talked about any of
it. Every topic deserves its own post but now you get a summary. What has
happened since my last post:</p>

<ul>
<li>My girlfriend of over a year moved in with me.</li>
<li>I have played a whole lot of tennis, but not nearly as much as I want to. I burned through those tennis shoes that I got just in time for the 6 month durability warranty and I still haven&#8217;t bought new racquets.</li>
<li>I have been playing a shit ton of video games and consider this to be the best year for gaming since 1998.</li>
<li>I have been building up my home theater which includes the HDTV I have mentioned before in addition to an Onkyo ht-sr800 htib, playstation 3, and an xbox 360.</li>
<li>I have enjoyed having the freedom of having a car and so far have found little to no faults in buying a used car.</li>
<li>I have been enjoying the new season of television which is about to end thanks to the writer&#8217;s strike. My favorite show has been Dexter.</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t taken nearly as many photos as I would like but have been studying photography a bit. I got a teleconverter lens and plan to get a macro lens soon.
Work has been crazy lately and exciting at the same time. I don&#8217;t see this
site ever being a place for me to talk about work because I believe in a
strict separation of my work and personal life, but since it takes up so much
of my mind I think it deserves some mention. It has been amazing to see a
place I have been at for ~3 years suddenly become a real startup and finally
begin to live up to the potential I saw in it coming out of college. This next
year is going to be very telling. I have had moments this year where I wasn&#8217;t
sure if I wanted to continue with my current job and Eugene to loving both
profusely. My company is in a position to become a globally recognized power
house and I am in a position where I can help to control its focus and
direction and hopefully reap from its success.</li>
</ul>


<p>Next week I leave on my first real vacation since moving here. I get to go
back to Hawaii where hopefully I can take a break from working and enjoy sand,
swimming, surfing, tennis, amazing food, sun, scuba diving, family and
hopefully a whole lot more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seventeen days after getting my license I have my first car. It is a 94 black
Honda Civic Si Hatchback.</p>

<p>It was pretty tempting to look at cars building up to when I was ready to get
my license, but I knew it would be pointless if I didn&#8217;t actually have a
license since all I could do is look. But in the mean time I had a pretty good
understanding of what I could expect to pay for a car. For my first car I had
a few goals: 1) cheap 2) reliable 3) low mileage 4) good gas mileage. By cheap
I mean under 3k. I wanted something that wouldn&#8217;t force me into having high
monthly car payments or high insurance payments. For reliable I knew I wanted
to go with an import car so either a Toyota or a Honda. I knew from experience
that Civics get good gas mileage so I wanted to look out for one of those but
for the price that I wanted and the mileage (under 100k) it was pretty hard to
find an imported car at that price range.</p>

<p>On my way back from tennis I ride along a street that for some reason is used
by people wanting to sell their cars. So the entire street is lined with
lunary cars that their owners probably couldn&#8217;t afford payments on and old
cars that look like they belong on a scrap heap. One of these caught my eye
and was an 83 Jetta with relatively low mileage. It was a good enough price
that I stopped riding to take a look at it. Right next to it though was a very
clean looking 94 Honda Civic Hatchback and surprisingly it was listed about
half what I would expect to see a Civic of that age and mileage at (just under
120k). So I rushed home to check Craigslist to see if the car was listed. It
had just been posted.</p>

<p>It turns out that the girl who was selling it lived right next store to me. I
had never seen her or the car because there is a row of trees blocking our
duplexes. So I wanted to check out the car to figure out what was wrong with
it. The reason why it was so cheap is because it is a salvage title. The
driver&#8217;s side door was totaled to the point that the car was deemed
unsalvageable. But this was before the current owner had ever owned the car.
The door was replaced with a perfect looking one so everything else about the
car looked great. Even the interior looked good for how old it was with no
weird smells, stains or tears.</p>

<p>The only problem was that the car had a manual transmission, which I haven&#8217;t
driven since Brett let me drive his truck. I took my license exam and spent
most of my time driving automatics. This wasn&#8217;t that big of an issue for me
though because I actually wanted a manual car in the long run because I feel
you get a better understanding of the car and are more attentive to whats
going on when you drive manual. But for the test drive purposes I wouldn&#8217;t get
a whole lot out of the experience so I brought Brett along. Brett is the kind
of drivers that people consider reckless but really he has a very good
understanding of the limitations of the cars he drives. So I actually feel
perfectly safe riding with him and I knew that he would be able to tell if
there was anything wrong with the car. He took it through the rope, testing
breaking, acceleration, turning, everything. The result was that the car ran
and felt great. It definitely felt like it accelerate way faster than my
girlfriend&#8217;s 99ish Civic.</p>

<p>Rather than buy the car outright I decided to see if I could finance it
through my credit union. I knew I could get a good rate on any loan due to my
credit history and I wanted an opportunity to build even more credit. One girl
at the bank looked at me weird when she saw how low the loan was for, but car
payments would only be around $100/month. So I was approved for the amount
easily enough at a 6% interest rate. The only issue is that the bank wanted to
see the title and the condition of the car before they would finalize the
loan. This meant having the owner of the car bring the title and the car to
the bank. The problem with this is that we both work at 9 and get off at 5,
with banks closing at 6. So in order to actually get to the bank in time we
would have to go through rush our traffic. We eventually got things sorted out
and found a branch that was close to where we lived and was able to finish the
loan.</p>

<p>Back at home, I was at last a car owner. Oddly enough it was the only car I
test drove but I got a great deal on it. Yeah its a salvage title but you
wouldn&#8217;t know it look at it or driving it. When I first started looking at
used cars a black Honda Civic is exactly what I wanted, and some how I lucked
out and found one at an incredible price. Now would come the joys of
remembering how to drive manual.</p>

<p>I have driven motorcycles and gone through a motorcycle safety class so
clutches aren&#8217;t entirely foreign to me. But for whatever reason I felt like a
complete idiot when I first got in the car. First of all the car wouldn&#8217;t
start (didn&#8217;t have the clutch all the way in), then I had to deal with
actually moving in the car. I began by driving around the neighborhood, once I
felt comfortable (and low on gas) I decided to try and go the gas station. The
first time I tried going on a major intersection I left a very nice patch of
tire on the street as I applied way more gas than I should have.</p>

<p>Eventually I found my way to a straight road with no traffic and practiced
stopping and going and shifting gears without stalling all over the place.
Hopefully in a week I will be good enough to be comfortable driving.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it took me a lot longer than other people (about 10 years longer), but I
finally got a driver&#8217;s license.</p>

<p>Growing up it was never a priority for me. My first experience driving was
when I was around 6 years old in the family Cadillac. I managed to put the car
in neutral and roll it out of the drive way. Since then my mom would get panic
attacks whenever I drove so learning with her wasn&#8217;t an option and I always
had friends who could give me rides around. Then I went off to college where I
didn&#8217;t need a car. Even in Eugene it wasn&#8217;t that big a priority as this is a
biker town and everything is pretty close. Still, not having a license has
been an embarrassment in the back of my mind and it is nice to finally be done
with it.</p>

<p>For the past year I have been driving my girlfriend around as she hates to
drive, so I was pretty confident going into the exam. I passed with only a
couple mistakes that I was able to point out before the examiner told me about
them. At least I can say that I passed my exam on the first try ;). I could
not have done it without my girlfriend&#8217;s encouragement as well as the
encouragement from my friends; &#8220;What, you still don&#8217;t have a license? How old
are you again?&#8221; Thanks guys. I am sure we can find something else to make fun
of now that that is out of the picture.</p>

<p>So now I get to go through the joys of buying a car. My goal is to find a used
japanese car for around $6-8k.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the big surprises about my new apartment was it proximity to Eugene&#8217;s
largest tennis club and Gold&#8217;s gym. It is actually about 3 blocks from Gold&#8217;s
and about 1.3 miles from Eugene Swim and Tennis Club.</p>

<p>Initially I had planned on getting a membership to both as I was planning on
joining a friend&#8217;s plan at Gold&#8217;s which was at an insanely low rate. This
didn&#8217;t pan out though so it made me strongly consider just doing the tennis
club for all my fitness needs. The tennis club&#8217;s weight lifting facilities and
cardio area were not nearly as good as Gold&#8217;s of course, but it more than made
up for it with all the tennis courts. The main issue with this though is that
the tennis club wasn&#8217;t cheap. They wanted a big sign up fee in addition to the
monthly fee. I decided to try and deal with the them and managed to talk them
down $100 from the sign up fee, so this made the tennis club much more
attractive.</p>

<p>I joined up on Thursday which also happened to be &#8220;men&#8217;s night&#8221; where all the
guys meet to play doubles. This allowed me to see what my main competition
was. Unfortunately with labor day weekend coming up there weren&#8217;t nearly as
many guys as there usually is. Most of the guys were 3.0-4.0 in skill which is
about average for club play. I was hoping for much more as I hit at a solid
4.5 level. I am comfortable saying I play at least at that level because I
used to play league tennis back in Hawaii at the 4.0 level and got some solid
wins. Since then I have improved a lot and one of my hitting partners is an
ex-tennis coach at the 4.5 level who I can stand toe-toe with in play. There
were some good guys playing at the club but no one blew me away. I played a
set with some old guys and expected to play much more but apparently they
don&#8217;t usually play much more than that. Coming from 3 hour hitting sessions I
didn&#8217;t get nearly the workout I wanted. I am not the fittest guy on the courts
but for the last couple of years I have been comparing my game and fitness to
the kids who play on the UO team and club. So compared to the average club
player that I saw I am in amazing shape.</p>

<p>A month or two ago I played doubles with this guy who was obviously pretty
good. He could paint the lines with his serve and hit every shot in the book.
My partner and I lost the first set pretty badly before we stepped it up the
second set for a solid win. The third set ended in a tie as I got a nasty
injury when the courts got a little wet - leading me to slip and lose some
skin on my hand and arm. I was impressed by the guys skill though and we
exchanged numbers hoping to play again some time.</p>

<p>It turns out he is a pro at the tennis club and recognized me as I was touring
the place. So his level of skill really set the bar for what I expect at the
club and it wasnt all that present at men&#8217;s night.</p>

<p>The cardio and weight facilities are good though and I hope to form a daily
routine around them when not playing tennis. Everyone seems to be friendly and
open to new members. I have already exchanged numbers with people who have
been there for over 10 years so it should be a lot of fun. No one except the
pro seems to be as big a tennis fanatic as I am - most seem to fit the
stereotype of a club player - drinking beer while casually watching tennis
between sets.</p>

<p>I may seem negative about the club so far but I am actually excited about the
opportunity of being able to hit with so many other people. Once this labor
day weekend gets over I should really get a good feel for the quality of
player the club has to offer. I am also excited about being involved in a
community that loves tennis. I have been enjoying the heck out of HD tennis on
my new television for the first time. I plan on watching the finals at the
club though to enjoy it with the other club members.</p>
