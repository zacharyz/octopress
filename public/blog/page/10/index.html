  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/IMG_0122.PNG" alt="" /> One of my favorite books ever is Snow Crash by Neal
Stephenson. It is a sci-fi novel centered around a sword wielding computer
hacker that has been extremely influential to many people working with
computers today. The word &#8220;avatar&#8221; in reference to a computer representation
of a person was first coined in this book - so just about every major MMO or
Virtual Reality system that has come out has been influenced by this book.</p>

<p>Another cool idea from Snow Crash was that of a &#8220;gargoyle,&#8221; which is basically
an individual who is perpetually connected to the net - complete with an eye
piece display that enables them pull up information about their surroundings
at all time. This is slowly becoming a reality and Yelp is doing their part by
bringing the first Augmented Reality app to the iPhone 3GS.</p>

<p>Yelp quietly snuck the feature into their latest update - revealed by shaking
your phone 3 times. After that a dialog pops up stating how Yelp thought
reality was boring - so they augmented it. From that point on the yelp app
displays a monocle option that allows you to use the 3GS&#8217;s camera to look
around and display yelp information.</p>

<p>Yelp isn&#8217;t the first AR app, but they are the first on the iphone. On android
based phones - like the G1, there have been other AR apps - in particular that
of <a href="http://layar.eu/">Layer</a>. Not until the 3GS did the iphone have a compass
which is crucial for determining which direction the user is pointing. Even
still the iphone was not supposed to see any AR apps until the next release of
the iphone OS software - so yelp is being sneaky by releasing it early.
Hopefully they aren&#8217;t angering the gods over at Apple.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I stumbled upon a great exposure blending tutorial by photographer
David Clapp. He does a good job of going through the steps required to get a
shot that has a great dynamic range - so there is excellent detail both in the
highlights of the picture as well as the shadows. This effect is usually only
possible with the use of expensive Neutral Gradient filters, but David shows
how it is possible to achieve the same effect by blending together multiple
exposures in photoshop.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out David&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.davidclapp.co.uk/exposureblending.php">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>At a recent coast trip I grabbed several exposures of a sunset with the
intention of making an HDR image, but I didn&#8217;t like the result generated by
the software. With David&#8217;s tutorial I was able to produce the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2641/3753222438_866a41c3eb_z.jpg" alt="sunset" /></p>

<p>While it isn&#8217;t the most interesting sunset, the final image does capture the
over all feel of the setting better than any of my individual exposures did by
themselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in about 2003 I was really getting into listening to music. I was tired
of lame computer speakers and my gameboy headphones from 1989 were no longer
cutting it. To satisfy my desire to have clear, quality audio I got a pair of
<a href="http://gradolabs.com/product_pages/sr80.htm">Grado SR-80</a> headphones. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grado_Labs">Grado
Labs</a> isn&#8217;t as famous to the average
music enthusiast as Sennheiser or Sony but around Hi-Fi audiophiles Grado has
made a name for themselves for providing a very crisp, neutral sound that is
true to the source material.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7637913@N07/3746485759/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/374648%0A5759_a7558de632_z.jpg" alt="kickin it with old school style" /></a>G
rado Labs is based out of Brooklyn and is a family owned business with the
sole purpose of manufacturing quality high-end audio products and it shows.
They make a wide range of headphones going from $49 iGrado street-style
headphones all the way up to crazy $1695 PS1000. The SR-80s were about $95
when I bought them. The main selling point for me was that they offered a
sound that was comparable to headphones that cost significantly more. If your
experience with headphones is limited to the cheap white ones that came with
your ipod then you are missing out on lot of detail in your music.</p>

<p>In about 2005 my headphones died due to a loose connection in one of the
drivers - probably because of over use. After a brief attempt at repairing
them myself which resulted in a mess of solder, I gave up not wanting to risk
doing more damage. In May of 2007 I was still bummed that these great
headphones were going to waste because of a tiny wire so I decided to send a
message to Grado to see if they could repair them. Despite the fact that the
headphones were a few years old they told me to send it in to the factory.</p>

<p>Holy Crap could a company really be that cool?</p>

<p>Thanks to my laziness I wouldn&#8217;t find out for another 2 years. At the
beginning of July I decided to take a chance and mailed off the headphones
along with a letter explaining my situation. I figured my options were to
either trash these headphones which were going on nearly 3 years of not being
used or to send them off to Grado where the worst that could happen is that
they would be recycled.</p>

<p>Well today I got an unexpected delivery in the mail from Grado. In the box
were my repaired headphones free of charge and they sound as good as they ever
have.</p>

<p>Thank you so much Grado!</p>

<time datetime="2009-07-21T00:38:30-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 21<span>st</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while now <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> has provided the ability to
look at what <a href="http://www.flickr.com/cameras/">cameras</a> are popular on their
site. These metrics are gathered when images or videos are uploaded to their
service. This has been a good way of gauging the over all popularity of
cameras among photography enthusiasts and can also serve as a way of
determining what camera to purchase.</p>

<h3>The Top Dogs</h3>

<p>The top camera list have long been dominated by Canon and Nikon. Canon has
routinely been the top camera manufacture thanks to the Rebel and SD line of
cameras. While Nikon has been in 2nd place thanks to the Nikon D80 and D40.</p>

<p>Something remarkable has been happening the last year though in that the list
of top cameras has a new member - the iPhone. The king of flickr - the Canon
XTi (aka EOS 400d) is close to being dethroned by a 2-3 megapixel camera
phone.</p>

<p><a href="http%0A://www.flickr.com/cameras/"><img src="http://dakry.com/images/top_flickr_cameras.png" alt="Top Camers on Flickr" /></a></p>

<h3>Why This is Remarkable</h3>

<p>These camera manufacturers make the bulk of their revenue with their cheaper
cameras. The high-end cameras like the Nikon D3 or Canon EOS 5d Mark II make
up a small fraction. Instead the lower end consumer cameras like the Canon SD
and Nikon Coolpix line of cameras are what bring in the money. These cameras
are cheaper to manufacture and their lower price points make them more
attractive to people who just want a simple camera.</p>

<h3>Why They Should be Afraid</h3>

<p><img src="http://dakry.com/images/iphone_flickr_usage.png" alt="iphone flickr usage" /></p>

<p>DSLR users are not likely to give up using their cameras as the image quality
of the iPhone isn&#8217;t anywhere near what you can achieve with even an entry
level DSLR. But if flickr&#8217;s stats are any indication of the future then camera
manufacturers should be very afraid of Apple right now as the iPhone directly
competes with the lower end consumer market which make up the bulk their
sales. Why bother carrying around a point and shoot when you already have a
camera phone that allows you to directly upload to flickr after you take a
shot?</p>

<p>Additionally <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10279970-37.html">rumors</a> have
been circulating that Apple has bought up a large batch of cheap cameras with
the intention of putting them in iPods. Can you imagine what the P&S; market
is going to be like when every person with an iPod will also have a decent
camera? It won&#8217;t be pretty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have had an ipod touch for just about 90 days now. Tomorrow I will be off to
Costco to take advantage of their awesome return policy. My refunded cash will
go towards the purchase of an iPhone 3GS (which due to supply shortages has
yet to ship). Since this will be my last night with this glorious device I
thought it fitting that this review be composed and published on it.</p>

<p>As I have previously mentioned on this blog, I have been a Sprint SERO
subscriber. My 2 year contract recently ended which opened up the possibility
of getting a new phone. My HTC Mogul isn&#8217;t cutting it anymore, not even with a
Windows Mobile 6.5 rom on it and since January I was nearly certain that I
would be getting a Pre. My original intention was to use my cheap SERO plan
for my &#8220;phone&#8221; purposes and my iPod for everything else.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Sprint requires that you subscribe to their more expensive phone
plans if you want to get a Pre. That requirement alone made me question
whether it was worth it for me to stay with Sprint. Aside from Sprint&#8217;s
customer service I have been happy. Especially considering I pay around
$32/month for it. The day before my contract ended I got a friendly call from
a support representative of which I was only able to understand roughly 25% of
what he had to say. I think he was asking me if I was happy and if there was
anything he could do for me, but all I heard was that I didn&#8217;t think I could
stand to put up with your customer service any longer.</p>

<p>The Pre itself is a marvelous device - both the device&#8217;s hardware design and
operating system is nearly everything I wanted in a mobile device. The
decision to not get a Pre came down to apps. In particular I looked at
Evernote, which had just come out on the Pre and the updated version for the
iphone&#8217;s 3.0 OS. The Pre&#8217;s version showed promise but the 3.0 version was by
far the superior app. I have no doubt that with time Pre developers will
produce amazing applications for it but from a user perspective I don&#8217;t want
to wait.</p>

<p>Additionally I didn&#8217;t see the Pre completely replacing everything that I use
the touch for. Yes the browser is fast, but the experience isn&#8217;t quite as well
done as what Apple has produced.</p>

<p>So what do I like about the ipod touch? For me it has been the ultimate
internet appliance. Combining all my internet needs inside a thin, light
device. When my computer is down or I feel like lounging on the patio, at a
friend&#8217;s place, or at a cafe the touch suits all my needs.</p>

<p>Recently I moved my main computer to another room where it would no longer
have a wired connection. I wanted to avoid using a pci wireless card because I
have experienced system instability while using them under high loads in the
past (like bittorrent). So instead I bought a 2nd router and used my touch to
configure it to support Wireless Distribution System. This mode had the effect
of extending my wireless network to this new router. Now I could plug my
computer directly into the 2nd router and use the connection of the first.
Since my computer didn&#8217;t have a wireless connection I would not have been able
to configure this 2nd router without my ipod touch.</p>

<p>What do I do on my touch on a daily basis?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>keep up with the news using Google Reader</p></li>
<li><p>check my email</p></li>
<li><p>keep up to date by having my calender automagically synced with my google calender</p></li>
<li><p>wake up with the great default clock application as well as use the timer for cooking and workouts</p></li>
<li><p>listen to audio books and podcasts (Pre doesn&#8217;t save positions in audiobooks)</p></li>
<li><p>buy and read books through Kindle (not supported on the Pre)</p></li>
<li><p>read twitter (with Tweetie)</p></li>
<li><p>browse Reddit using iReddit</p></li>
<li><p>browse flickr</p></li>
<li><p>take and read notes using Evernote</p></li>
<li><p>find new restaurants using Yelp</p></li>
<li><p>track my runs using Nike+</p></li>
<li><p>track my pushup and situp programs using dedicated apps</p></li>
<li><p>control VLC and iTunes</p></li>
<li><p>chat with gtalk, aim and Facebook using BeeJive 3.0</p></li>
<li><p>keep up with my facebook contacts using the dedicated app (really Palm you couldn&#8217;t have had one at launch?)</p></li>
<li><p>manage my blog with a dedicated wordpress app (just found out I could do this today!)</p></li>
<li><p>track my bank account using Mint</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The majority of the things I use my touch for on a regular basis are either
not supported on the Pre or would not have offered as good of an experience.
So in the end I would have still needed to carry around two devices.</p>

<p>Without a doubt the touch is a gateway drug to the iphone. You can&#8217;t
appreciate all that the touch has to offer and not want to be able to do
everything and more with phone and gps functionality like the iphone can. I
look forward to not needing WiFi access everywhere and being able to use
location aware services.</p>

<p>So long my beloved ipod touch. You have served me well. You will be dearly
missed during the time that I return you and when I finally get my iphone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since getting a D40 back in March a lot has happened. I have really grown to
love photography and look forward to every trip and hike as an excuse to take
more pictures. I have gobbled up several books on the subject and have since
invested in a new lens and flash. I seldom go anywhere now without a camera.</p>

<p>I realized within a month of getting the D40 that I was going to out grow it
fast. It’s a great camera that takes amazing exposures and easily recommend it
over point and shoot cameras that cost more - but there are several
limitations that I won&#8217;t cover here. Since I was happy with Nikon in general I
knew I would want to stay with their line of cameras. So my options were to
upgrade to the D80 or splurge on a D300. The D80 has long been at the end of
its product cycle - so while I could get it affordably I knew it wouldn&#8217;t be
the upgrade that I really wanted. The D300 is considered one of the best
cameras to come out in the past year and is without a doubt my ideal upgrade.
But the cost was prohibitive. I enjoy photography but I am not willing to
spend upwards of $2k on a camera at this point.</p>

<p>Enter the D90.</p>

<p>The D90 has had an interesting journey. Those who follow DSLRs have known that
Nikon was certainly working on this camera. The D80 - while be very popular -
was looking long in the tooth compared to recent offerings by Canon. Most
notably the lack of LiveView and an old image sensor. This lead people to
theorize what would make a worthy successor. The dream was a D80 combined with
the award winning features of the D300. Nikon managed to deliver on that dream
and more.</p>

<p>The D90 inherits the D300 image sensor. Meaning it&#8217;s megapixel count has been
bumped to 12 and it&#8217;s sensitivity has increased dramatically over the D80
(from 3200 to 6400). It&#8217;s LCD has been increased to 3 inches and has gained
Live View. In what many consider the biggest surprise the D90 is the first
DSLR to include video recording. Though this is probably the feature that I am
the least excited about.</p>

<p>A full feature comparison and &#8220;preview&#8221; can be found
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0808/08082702nikond90previewed.asp">here</a>. Chase
Jarvis did a fun post and video on the camera. You can find it
<a href="http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/2008/08/chase-jarvis-raw-advance-%0Atesting-nikon.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I had planned on waiting until October or November for the body only release
of the D90 - but the combination of an upcoming vacation and a friend&#8217;s
wedding had made me want to upgrade sooner. I had been saving up in
anticipation of the upgrade for a while so I was ready to purchase it whenever
it was available. On Monday I found out the local Best Buy had a one and
reserved it but I still wasn&#8217;t certain as to whether I should make the
purchase as I am hesitant about making any big purchase. I shopped around at
the local camera stores and no one else had it in stock and luckily for me
Best Buy offered no interest financing for 2 years. That sealed the deal for
me - happy belated birthday to myself. I may very well be one of the first
people in Eugene with a D90.</p>

<p>So how is it?</p>

<p>Its everything I hoped for and more. It is a gigantic upgrade over my D40
while providing all the important features that I needed from the D300. There
are some things that I will probably miss (weather proofing, lens focus
tuning) but I can live without those for now. Shooting without a flash at
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7637913@N07/sets/72157607086403265/">PAX</a> on a
D40 revealed a lot more noise than I would have liked. In comparison the D90
is able to take great looking pictures at 3200 where the D40 was barely able
to get by at 1600. Also I am able to use auto-focus on primes like my 50mm
1.8.</p>

<p>One of the major features I wanted from a D80 was the flash commander mode.
This allows you to use flashes off camera and control them from the camera. I
plan to get into <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/">Strobist</a> like photography in
the future.</p>

<p>I plan on selling the kit lens that came with it. While it is apparently a
good lens and well reviewed - I don&#8217;t need it. I bought a Tamron 17-50 2.8
lens a few months back and have since not had a reason to use any of my other
lenses. So if anyone wants a 18-105 VR lens before it is sold in stores, I am
willing to part with it unused and with the warranty for $300.</p>

<p>Additionally my D40 is now for sale. I am willing to part with it and the
original kit lens for $300. That includes a spare battery. For $150 more I
will throw in my 55-200 VR kit lens. The D40 kit still sells for new at $460
at most stores - you can get it used with the 55-200 VR for less than that
from me. My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7637913@N07/">flickr account</a> is
filled with pictures that I took with this camera.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For as long as I have been playing tennis I have always bought the cheapest
strings. If it cost more than $10 total to get a racquet strung then I was
going to shop elsewhere. Anything more I considered superfluous - really how
big a difference is it going make?</p>

<p>The local tennis shop closed recently which has forced me to get my racquets
strung at my club. The club has a weird stringing pricing structure that
results in the cheapest string being about $3 cheaper than the most expensive
string. The first couples of times I opted to use their services I asked for
the cheapest more durable stuff they had - it ended up lasting about a month
for my two racquets and was barely cheaper then their most expensive stuff.</p>

<p>This time I went with the string that a lot of pros use - <a href="http://www.tennis-%0Awarehouse.com/Reviews/ALUSTR/ALUSTRReview.html">Luxilon Big Banger
ALU Power 16L</a>. This was the string of choice
for Agassi and is still used by the majority of pros on tour. From the first
strike I could feel the difference. I had assumed that given the name this
string was all about generating power - which isn&#8217;t something I care about as
I hit with a relatively heavy racquet and am more than capable of generating
my own pace. This string actually does the opposite -it&#8217;s all about control.
The more control you have the freer you are to use your own power.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my last string job&#8217;s life I was definitely getting angry
with how little control it had. In general the tighter you string your
racquets the more control you have. So since these strings were about a month
old they didn&#8217;t offer much in the way of control. It felt like whenever I
connected with the ball I would have to guide and baby it over the net. With
the Luxilon the only thing I had to concentrate on was to make sure that I was
hitting well balanced shots. If I did that then the ball went where I was
aiming. Once I realized that then I was free to hit the ball with as much pace
as I could muster.</p>

<p>I have only had one hitting session with these new strings and I haven&#8217;t
played any matches with them yet - but consider me sold. The world of quality
strings has opened to me.</p>

<p>update (9/4/08): I bumped into the guy who does my strings at the club
yesterday and he informed me that they were in fact out of the Luxilon strings
that I had requested. So instead he strung my racquets with <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpageACGAMMA-GZOP.html">Gamma
Zo</a> at a discount.</p>

<p>Overall I am still very impressed. I find myself hitting the ball with more
pace and control than ever before and if anything I am more curious than ever
as to what better strings can do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently upgraded my flickr to a pro account which has inspired me to backup
all the old photos I took with my Canon S3IS. While doing so I stumbled across
some panoramas I took during my vacation last year but never stitched together
so I decided to try and find a way to develop them.</p>

<p>When I first saw them I had forgotten that they were part of a panorama,
because by themselves the shots weren&#8217;t very remarkable. When I tried to
manually stitch them together in photoshop I found them to be misaligned.
Thankfully CS3 has a feature that automates the merging of pictures. You
basically give it a list of photos and it will try to create a panorama out of
them.</p>

<p>Here are results:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I settled on the idea that I was definitely going to get a DSLR I
have been doing loads of research into the type of camera that I wanted along
with what kind of lenses. When it became apparent that I spent more time in
Nikon photography forums and researching Nikon lenses then I decided it was
finally time to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>So what did I get?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nikon D40 6.1 Megapixel Digital SLR Camera w/18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom Nikkor Lens
I was tempted to get the body only and go with the VR lens. But based on my
experience with a super-zoom p&s; I knew I would most often find myself
towards the end of the focal range. Instead of getting the 18-55mm VR lens I
decided to put that money towards the next lens.</p></li>
<li><p>Nikon Zoom Normal-Telephoto 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Autofocus Lens
This lens is super popular and considered a great deal. This combined with the
kit lens will give me a focal range of 18-200mm. In the future I may consider
investing in the 18-200mm VR, but for now I don&#8217;t mind changing lenses.</p></li>
<li><p>Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens
This lens was a bit of a surprise. Up until the last week I hadn&#8217;t even
considered such a lens. It is a prime lens so unlike what I am used to using I
can not zoom in on subjects. Instead I have to move around. Additionally due
to the limitations of the D40/D40x/D60 bodies the lens won&#8217;t autofocus. So
instead I have to manual focus everything. The more I thought about this the
more it excited me. The 50mm f/1.8D is one of the cheapest lenses you can buy
yet it is known for producing exceptionally sharp images. It is also a very
quick lens and functions very well low lighting conditions compared to the two
zoom lenses I got. I am really looking forward to learning how to manually
focus shots.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I saw some really good deals on XTIs but the Canon body didn&#8217;t feel as good in
my hands as the d40 did. The same goes for Pentax&#8217;s cameras.</p>

<p>I was really tempted to get a D80 due to its built in autofocus mechnics, but
I ended up spending all together less for D40+3 lenses than I would have spent
if I had gotten the D80 body alone. Also I really liked how much lighter and
smaller the D40 is in comparison.</p>

<p>The D60 also came out at the end of the last month. It is currently selling
about $70 less than the original MSRP. Still at that price I couldn&#8217;t justify
paying so much more on a body for features I don&#8217;t really need.</p>
