<div class="entry-content"><p>For as long as I have been playing tennis I have always bought the cheapest
strings. If it cost more than $10 total to get a racquet strung then I was
going to shop elsewhere. Anything more I considered superfluous - really how
big a difference is it going make?</p>

<p>The local tennis shop closed recently which has forced me to get my racquets
strung at my club. The club has a weird stringing pricing structure that
results in the cheapest string being about $3 cheaper than the most expensive
string. The first couples of times I opted to use their services I asked for
the cheapest more durable stuff they had - it ended up lasting about a month
for my two racquets and was barely cheaper then their most expensive stuff.</p>

<p>This time I went with the string that a lot of pros use - <a href="http://www.tennis-%0Awarehouse.com/Reviews/ALUSTR/ALUSTRReview.html">Luxilon Big Banger
ALU Power 16L</a>. This was the string of choice
for Agassi and is still used by the majority of pros on tour. From the first
strike I could feel the difference. I had assumed that given the name this
string was all about generating power - which isn&#8217;t something I care about as
I hit with a relatively heavy racquet and am more than capable of generating
my own pace. This string actually does the opposite -it&#8217;s all about control.
The more control you have the freer you are to use your own power.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my last string job&#8217;s life I was definitely getting angry
with how little control it had. In general the tighter you string your
racquets the more control you have. So since these strings were about a month
old they didn&#8217;t offer much in the way of control. It felt like whenever I
connected with the ball I would have to guide and baby it over the net. With
the Luxilon the only thing I had to concentrate on was to make sure that I was
hitting well balanced shots. If I did that then the ball went where I was
aiming. Once I realized that then I was free to hit the ball with as much pace
as I could muster.</p>

<p>I have only had one hitting session with these new strings and I haven&#8217;t
played any matches with them yet - but consider me sold. The world of quality
strings has opened to me.</p>

<p>update (9/4/08): I bumped into the guy who does my strings at the club
yesterday and he informed me that they were in fact out of the Luxilon strings
that I had requested. So instead he strung my racquets with <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpageACGAMMA-GZOP.html">Gamma
Zo</a> at a discount.</p>

<p>Overall I am still very impressed. I find myself hitting the ball with more
pace and control than ever before and if anything I am more curious than ever
as to what better strings can do.</p>
