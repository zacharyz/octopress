<div class="entry-content"><p>Sprint sales reps are awesome. They have clear voices and are easy to
communicate with. They are great at selling phones. Beyond that - Fuck Sprint.</p>

<p>Today my Moto Q died. Thankfully it was the last day of my 30 day trial
period. So I called Sprint to send back my existing phone and to get a
different phone since I was tired of dealing with undependable phones.</p>

<p>It was relatively easy to get a rep who was able to print out a label for me
to return my phone. From there it was nothing but pain.</p>

<p>I want to get the Mogul by HTC. They managed to start selling it the day after
I originally ordered my Moto Q. It is another windows mobile phone only its
WM6 and a huge improvement over the other phones offered at the time. The
first rep I got barely spoke english and was actually trying to sell me the
phone. He started rattling off phone features &#8220;umm it has mp3, it has email,
it is good phone.&#8221; Keep in mind I was the one who told him the Mogul is the
phone I wanted to order. Then he told me I would have to pay full retail for
it. Then he hung up. WTF.</p>

<p>While on hold the office phone I was on managed to run out of juice but
magically my Moto Q managed to boot again. Apparently this is a common error
with Moto Qs.</p>

<p>A few more attempts at getting through only to be given 3 different automated
responses that all resulted in the number I was trying to call being down.</p>

<p>I once got through to a rep who wanted to forward me to the very same number -
which of course ended up in nothing again.I call sales again in hopes of
actually talking to someone who speaks english and get this girl. I explain
how the other number is down so she puts me on hold and waits for the number
to connect while I am on hold. Every 2-3 minutes she picks up and asks if I
would like to be on hold some more or hang up. After 1 hour they changed the
classical song to one that was much louder - this almost made me want to hang
up. 15 minutes more of this and I finally get through to a girl who sounds
Mexican. The first thing I do is try to take it off speaker phone so I can
actually talk to her&#8230; and I hang up the phone on accident.</p>

<p>At this point I am pissed. I immediately try and call the number I was trying
to connect with and was greeted by an automated voice saying the system was
down. So then I call back sales again and amazingly get a guy rep (first time
ever). I explain to him my situation and he actually does what everyone else
was transferring me to other people to do. The gist: in order to get a
different phone I have to send back my current phone and then order a new
phone. Otherwise I have to buy a full retail phone. So after numerous calls
and forwards and being on hold for most of the morning I get told something
that should have been answered by the first dude I talked to.</p>

<p>Fuck You Sprint customer service. But thanks dude who was able to actually be
helpful.</p>
