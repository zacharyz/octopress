<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the big surprises about my new apartment was it proximity to Eugene&#8217;s
largest tennis club and Gold&#8217;s gym. It is actually about 3 blocks from Gold&#8217;s
and about 1.3 miles from Eugene Swim and Tennis Club.</p>

<p>Initially I had planned on getting a membership to both as I was planning on
joining a friend&#8217;s plan at Gold&#8217;s which was at an insanely low rate. This
didn&#8217;t pan out though so it made me strongly consider just doing the tennis
club for all my fitness needs. The tennis club&#8217;s weight lifting facilities and
cardio area were not nearly as good as Gold&#8217;s of course, but it more than made
up for it with all the tennis courts. The main issue with this though is that
the tennis club wasn&#8217;t cheap. They wanted a big sign up fee in addition to the
monthly fee. I decided to try and deal with the them and managed to talk them
down $100 from the sign up fee, so this made the tennis club much more
attractive.</p>

<p>I joined up on Thursday which also happened to be &#8220;men&#8217;s night&#8221; where all the
guys meet to play doubles. This allowed me to see what my main competition
was. Unfortunately with labor day weekend coming up there weren&#8217;t nearly as
many guys as there usually is. Most of the guys were 3.0-4.0 in skill which is
about average for club play. I was hoping for much more as I hit at a solid
4.5 level. I am comfortable saying I play at least at that level because I
used to play league tennis back in Hawaii at the 4.0 level and got some solid
wins. Since then I have improved a lot and one of my hitting partners is an
ex-tennis coach at the 4.5 level who I can stand toe-toe with in play. There
were some good guys playing at the club but no one blew me away. I played a
set with some old guys and expected to play much more but apparently they
don&#8217;t usually play much more than that. Coming from 3 hour hitting sessions I
didn&#8217;t get nearly the workout I wanted. I am not the fittest guy on the courts
but for the last couple of years I have been comparing my game and fitness to
the kids who play on the UO team and club. So compared to the average club
player that I saw I am in amazing shape.</p>

<p>A month or two ago I played doubles with this guy who was obviously pretty
good. He could paint the lines with his serve and hit every shot in the book.
My partner and I lost the first set pretty badly before we stepped it up the
second set for a solid win. The third set ended in a tie as I got a nasty
injury when the courts got a little wet - leading me to slip and lose some
skin on my hand and arm. I was impressed by the guys skill though and we
exchanged numbers hoping to play again some time.</p>

<p>It turns out he is a pro at the tennis club and recognized me as I was touring
the place. So his level of skill really set the bar for what I expect at the
club and it wasnt all that present at men&#8217;s night.</p>

<p>The cardio and weight facilities are good though and I hope to form a daily
routine around them when not playing tennis. Everyone seems to be friendly and
open to new members. I have already exchanged numbers with people who have
been there for over 10 years so it should be a lot of fun. No one except the
pro seems to be as big a tennis fanatic as I am - most seem to fit the
stereotype of a club player - drinking beer while casually watching tennis
between sets.</p>

<p>I may seem negative about the club so far but I am actually excited about the
opportunity of being able to hit with so many other people. Once this labor
day weekend gets over I should really get a good feel for the quality of
player the club has to offer. I am also excited about being involved in a
community that loves tennis. I have been enjoying the heck out of HD tennis on
my new television for the first time. I plan on watching the finals at the
club though to enjoy it with the other club members.</p>
