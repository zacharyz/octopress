<div class="entry-content"><p>Those who live in Eugene know that the place is situated between two buttes.
The closest located in northern Eugene is Skinner&#8217;s butte (who principle
Skinner on the Simpsons get his name from) and the other located on the
southern end called Spencer&#8217;s Butte. Spencer&#8217;s is more of a hike while the
other has a fun rock climbing face.</p>

<p>Last weekend Brett, Craig and I decided to enjoy the weather and hit up
Spencer&#8217;s for a quick hike and hopefully make it fast enough to catch the
sunset from atop the butte. We also used the chance to play with our cameras.
Brett has a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi so I was pretty interested in how my
&#8220;super zoom&#8221; camera would compare in the lighting conditions.</p>

<p>Right off the back Brett&#8217;s camera was able to take better shots of Craig and I
than I have him.</p>

crocs" /></p>

<p>All my shots of him came out blurry due to the lighting and our movement.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/206/493425251_1a19e64474.jpg" alt="blurry mess" /></p>

<p>The conditions were a lot muddier than I had ever experienced before I prior
hikes, but otherwise it was a fun hike. I managed to catch a lot of &#8220;sun
behind the branches&#8221; shots. I think mine turned out nicer over all than
Brett&#8217;s.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/227/493368006_e506e848a9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We arrived at the top to find a few people already there. The &#8220;seal&#8221; that
marked the top of the butte was removed and in its place was a tree branch
that was ideal for steadying our cameras.</p>

<p>There was a bunch of birds flying about, which gave me a good opportunity to
test out my zoom against moving targets.</p>

<p>I was able to get in pretty close and see that what I first thought were
hawks, were in fact buzzards.</p>

<p>Of course we took a bunch of shots of the sunset and surrounding scenery.

<p>I grabbed this next shot on our way back down. Craig had thought it would make
a good shot. Brett&#8217;s version had actually turned out washed out with very
little detail and the surrounding trees black.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/198/493369346_a980f7126e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The trip down was actually a lot of fun. Rather than go the way we came we
were recommended by a fellow hiker to go down the other side, which was far
steeper but would eventually meet up with our original path. The steepness
combined with the mud made for a lot of moments where we were skiing down the
slopes.</p>

<p>Overall it made for a pleasant evening hike that provided some great exercise
and photos.</p>
