panorama made up of about 11 overlapping shots. I took it as I was making my
way down from the summit. It wasn't until I was making the journey down that I
really had an appreciation for just how beastly a journey it had been (8 hours
to the top for me).</p>

<p>One of the things I like about this shot is that you can see tiny specs that
are other hikers making the same journey that I had made.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5565645881/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5565645881_56829923%0Add_z.jpg" alt="london bridge pano" /></a></p>

<p>If you haven't noticed - <a href="http://zaczadell.com/tag/panoramas/">I love
panoramas.</a> I think they do a fantastic
job of capturing the feel of a location much better than any single picture
could and they aren't all that difficult to produce. Here is a quick tutorial
on the methods that I use to take awesome travel panoramas.</p>

<p>I generally rely on two primary methods for taking them - either with my big
dslr and photoshop or my iphone and a stitching app.</p>

<h3>DSLR, Photoshop and Optionally a Tripod</h3>

<p>This is the more established method that I use when I want something that I
intend to either print out or blow up later. The method requires that I take
several pictures that slightly overlap with a wide angle lens. If I can I will
use my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015MFTE4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ftp0e-%0A20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0015MFTE4">tripod</a> that has a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UOCWUK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ftp0e-2%0A0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002UOCWUK">panning head</a> on it, which
allows me to take sharp shots with precise overlap.</p>

<p>When a tripod isn't available though I simply snap a bunch of pictures and
manually pan from left to right (or vica verca) across the scene.</p>

<p>Once you get the hang of it, the process takes only slightly longer than
taking a single shot. I tend to take 3-5 shots for every panorama.</p>

<p>The next step is to use photoshop's <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/P%0Ahotoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-75e8a.html">photomerge</a> feature. You
give it a list of pictures and it will try and blend them together in a
meaningful way - usually a panorama.</p>

<h3>Iphone + autostitch app</h3>

<p>I can't always have my camera + tripod with me but I will most likely have my
phone. For the cost of a cheap app (under $3 and totally worth every penny), I
can grab panoramas wherever I go. I use
<a href="http://www.cloudburstresearch.com/autostitch/autostitch.html">autostitch</a>.</p>

<p>This method won't yield the sharpest results but it will definitely be better
than nothing. The iphone's lens isn't very wide, so be sure to capture shots
both above and below the shots that make up your panorama. This will allow you
to take in some of the sky and ground. So instead of 3 shots you will end up
taking around 9. Autostich is a champ at combining everything together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5565642185/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5225/5565642185_9bc61d33e7_z.jpg" alt="london eye" /></a> <a href="http:%0A//www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5586210202/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5293/5586210202_193784efea_z.jpg" alt="Tralafagar Square Pan
orama" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr%0A.com/photos/zacharyz/5566228732/"><img src="http:%0A//farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5566228732_2d085237bb_z.jpg" alt="Saint Peters Cathedral" /></a> You can also use the same method to take
vertical shots aka vertoramas. This picture of Saint Peters Cathedral is made
up of 3 images taken while panning vertically. Despite having a very wide
angle lens (10mm) there is no other way I could have captured the entire
building from that position without using this method.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and let me know if you want me to go into any greater
detail into what exactly is involved. Otherwise this should be enough to get
you started in taking awesome travel panoramas yourself.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5564207887/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/55642078%0A87_549fde6b4d_b.jpg" alt="Eiffel Tower Before the Storm" /></a></p>

<p>The weather in Paris didn't quite work out for me. I had planned on spending
the evening photographing the city at night only to find myself in a race to
stay dry while still getting <em>some</em> shots of the iconic tower. I had gone on a
3 hour tour the city after exploring the Louvre and was exhausted at this
point. I only had enough time to grab a few shots and ask some friendly
tourists to grab some shots of myself before the sky opened up and drenched
everyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5564797602/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5011/5564797602_80%0A1c2c9aee_z.jpg" alt="Keeping Dry in the Metro" /></a></p>

<p>Oddly enough I met a ton of awesome Spanish people on this trip. I stayed in a
cheap hostel that had mixed dorms and ended up rooming with college-aged
Spanish girls. On the tour I ended up also meeting a bunch of guys from
Barcelona and Madrid. Their friendliness definitely convinced me to add Spain
to my future travels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharyz/5564790182/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5183/5564790182_%0A4cb0844ff4_b.jpg" alt="Nyarr and the Eiffel Tower" /></a></p>

<p>One of my goals for this trip was to travel as light as possible (while still
carrying my camera + lenses). I ended up not bringing my laptop or tripod and
wearing exclusively my vibram five fingers. The other tourists really got a
kick out of my vffs.</p>

<p>During one point in the trip I was sprinting between metros trying to make it
to my flight on time. A friendly French dude ended up leading me Parkour-style
over the ticket stalls and showing me how to avoid getting caught in the
process. Overall the French that I encountered left a really good impression
on me.</p>
