    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For as long as I have been playing tennis I have always bought the cheapest
strings. If it cost more than $10 total to get a racquet strung then I was
going to shop elsewhere. Anything more I considered superfluous - really how
big a difference is it going make?</p>

<p>The local tennis shop closed recently which has forced me to get my racquets
strung at my club. The club has a weird stringing pricing structure that
results in the cheapest string being about $3 cheaper than the most expensive
string. The first couples of times I opted to use their services I asked for
the cheapest more durable stuff they had - it ended up lasting about a month
for my two racquets and was barely cheaper then their most expensive stuff.</p>

<p>This time I went with the string that a lot of pros use - <a href="http://www.tennis-%0Awarehouse.com/Reviews/ALUSTR/ALUSTRReview.html">Luxilon Big Banger
ALU Power 16L</a>. This was the string of choice
for Agassi and is still used by the majority of pros on tour. From the first
strike I could feel the difference. I had assumed that given the name this
string was all about generating power - which isn't something I care about as
I hit with a relatively heavy racquet and am more than capable of generating
my own pace. This string actually does the opposite -it's all about control.
The more control you have the freer you are to use your own power.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my last string job's life I was definitely getting angry
with how little control it had. In general the tighter you string your
racquets the more control you have. So since these strings were about a month
old they didn't offer much in the way of control. It felt like whenever I
connected with the ball I would have to guide and baby it over the net. With
the Luxilon the only thing I had to concentrate on was to make sure that I was
hitting well balanced shots. If I did that then the ball went where I was
aiming. Once I realized that then I was free to hit the ball with as much pace
as I could muster.</p>

<p>I have only had one hitting session with these new strings and I haven't
played any matches with them yet - but consider me sold. The world of quality
strings has opened to me.</p>

<p>update (9/4/08): I bumped into the guy who does my strings at the club
yesterday and he informed me that they were in fact out of the Luxilon strings
that I had requested. So instead he strung my racquets with <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpageACGAMMA-GZOP.html">Gamma
Zo</a> at a discount.</p>

<p>Overall I am still very impressed. I find myself hitting the ball with more
pace and control than ever before and if anything I am more curious than ever
as to what better strings can do.</p>

    <id>http://dakry.com/blog/2007/09/03/tennis-club-aka-my-second-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the big surprises about my new apartment was it proximity to Eugene's
largest tennis club and Gold's gym. It is actually about 3 blocks from Gold's
and about 1.3 miles from Eugene Swim and Tennis Club.</p>

<p>Initially I had planned on getting a membership to both as I was planning on
joining a friend's plan at Gold's which was at an insanely low rate. This
didn't pan out though so it made me strongly consider just doing the tennis
club for all my fitness needs. The tennis club's weight lifting facilities and
cardio area were not nearly as good as Gold's of course, but it more than made
up for it with all the tennis courts. The main issue with this though is that
the tennis club wasn't cheap. They wanted a big sign up fee in addition to the
monthly fee. I decided to try and deal with the them and managed to talk them
down $100 from the sign up fee, so this made the tennis club much more
attractive.</p>

<p>I joined up on Thursday which also happened to be "men's night" where all the
guys meet to play doubles. This allowed me to see what my main competition
was. Unfortunately with labor day weekend coming up there weren't nearly as
many guys as there usually is. Most of the guys were 3.0-4.0 in skill which is
about average for club play. I was hoping for much more as I hit at a solid
4.5 level. I am comfortable saying I play at least at that level because I
used to play league tennis back in Hawaii at the 4.0 level and got some solid
wins. Since then I have improved a lot and one of my hitting partners is an
ex-tennis coach at the 4.5 level who I can stand toe-toe with in play. There
were some good guys playing at the club but no one blew me away. I played a
set with some old guys and expected to play much more but apparently they
don't usually play much more than that. Coming from 3 hour hitting sessions I
didn't get nearly the workout I wanted. I am not the fittest guy on the courts
but for the last couple of years I have been comparing my game and fitness to
the kids who play on the UO team and club. So compared to the average club
player that I saw I am in amazing shape.</p>

<p>A month or two ago I played doubles with this guy who was obviously pretty
good. He could paint the lines with his serve and hit every shot in the book.
My partner and I lost the first set pretty badly before we stepped it up the
second set for a solid win. The third set ended in a tie as I got a nasty
injury when the courts got a little wet - leading me to slip and lose some
skin on my hand and arm. I was impressed by the guys skill though and we
exchanged numbers hoping to play again some time.</p>

<p>It turns out he is a pro at the tennis club and recognized me as I was touring
the place. So his level of skill really set the bar for what I expect at the
club and it wasnt all that present at men's night.</p>

<p>The cardio and weight facilities are good though and I hope to form a daily
routine around them when not playing tennis. Everyone seems to be friendly and
open to new members. I have already exchanged numbers with people who have
been there for over 10 years so it should be a lot of fun. No one except the
pro seems to be as big a tennis fanatic as I am - most seem to fit the
stereotype of a club player - drinking beer while casually watching tennis
between sets.</p>

<p>I may seem negative about the club so far but I am actually excited about the
opportunity of being able to hit with so many other people. Once this labor
day weekend gets over I should really get a good feel for the quality of
player the club has to offer. I am also excited about being involved in a
community that loves tennis. I have been enjoying the heck out of HD tennis on
my new television for the first time. I plan on watching the finals at the
club though to enjoy it with the other club members.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a while since I got a new pair of tennis shoes. I have wide feet
and have been a big fan of the nike air resolve line of shoes. They are a few
seasons old so you can find them for cheap. The main thing that drew me to
them is that they are built like tanks.</p>

<p><img src="http://rs.tennis-warehouse.com/tw/ProductImages/NMRW.JPG" alt="" /><img src="http://rs%0A.tennis-warehouse.com/tw/ProductImages/NAMRPLB.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is hard to tell from those images but the toe area is surrounded by some
fairly durable plastic. Still, after about 9 months of play I managed to grind
that plastic away. My main issue with those shoes is that the durability came
at the cost of weight. They come in at around 16.9 ounces. Opponents consider
me pretty speedy around the court but I always felt like I was weighed down by
those shoes.</p>

<p>While returning a demo racquet at the local tennis shop today I ended up
getting a pair of Nike Max Breathe Free IIs.</p>

<p><img src="http://rs.tennis-warehouse.com/tw/ProductImages/AMBFWBB.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>They came pretty highly recommended on the tennis-warehouse forums, and were
the best fitting shoes out of the bunch that I tried. They come in at about
15.5 ounces which on paper doesn't seem all that much lighter. But on court
today turned out to be a drastic difference. My hitting partner remarked on
several occasions that I was able to track down shots he thought were
impossible to retrieve. They definitely felt a lot lighter and more
maneuverable than any tennis shoe that I have used before.</p>

<p>They may not appear to be as durable as the air resolves but they still come
with a 6 month warranty. So if I play like I have been playing I will most
likely get a second pair for free.</p>

<p>On another note just before winning my 4th straight game of 21 I managed to
roll my ankle. Thankfully it doesn't appear to be as bad as previous rolls :/.</p>

    <link href="http://dakry.com/blog/2007/05/07/sampras-won-a-title/"/>
    <updated>2007-05-07T18:35:55-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dakry.com/blog/2007/05/07/sampras-won-a-title</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yeah we have heard that news a million times before over the years. What is
different is that he has been retired from tennis for almost 4 years now and
that he won a title over the weekend and that it was on clay. He did it in
Boston - along the way beat a bunch of old champions like McEnroe and Martin.</p>

<p>Why is this remarkable? Well apparently he is using a new racquet after using
the same exact racquet for the majority of his career. The lighter and bigger
racquet allows him to hit the ball better than he could in his prime
(according to him and the guys he beat). Whoa what does this mean!? I could
use this post to go into how pros don't use newer racquets when newer models
come out and instead use what people call "paint jobs", but I will save that
for another post. Without a doubt though Sampras refused to even paint his
racquets different colors in the past so he is actually pimping new
technology.</p>

<p>Sampras and Federer played once at Wimbledon in 2001. That was was passed
Sampras' prime but would still go on to win the USO the next year and Federer
wouldn't reach his stride from another couple years. Regardless the two had an
epic battle 7-6(7) 5-7 6-4 6-7(2) 7-5 with Federer winning the match. Tennis
buffs will remember this match as a passing of the torch sort of moment.
Everyone could see the potential that Federer had from that match.</p>

<p>Federer obviously looked up to Sampras. At the time they used the same shoes,
the same racquet and even today his service motion is very similar (same
motion for all his serves).</p>

<p>Last year when Sampras got tooled by Robby Ginepri in an exhibition match I
was one of the few people who didn't think Sampras had a chance to come back
and face Federer. The only reason why that match was as close as it was, is
because Ginepri made it close. Sampras's strokes were horrible and he could
barely keep a backhand in. The only thing he had was his serve and volley. He
definitely made a lot of great volleys that game, that were better than
anything you see on the pro tour today. But they weren't enough to win
matches. But wait - now he is hitting the ball cleaner than in his prime?</p>

<p>If you have watched Wimbledon before you will notice that by the end of the
tournament the courts are brown and dead where the players spend the most
time. When Sampras played there was a clear path to the net and around it from
all the serve and volleyers that dominated the game - Sampras included. But
the last few years this hasn't been the case and instead the majority of the
court is green except behind the baseline.</p>

<p>Serve and Volley is the ideal strategy for Wimbledon because the balls move so
fast and stays low on the grass surface. So by serve and volleying you speed
up the game and limit how much time your opponent can take a shot. Grass also
has a tendency to have irregular bounces making it hard to judge shots. This
is in contrast to hardcourts and clay courts where the ball bounces more and
gives players more time to focus their shots.</p>

<p>So the place that Sampras won so many times is dominated by a strategy that
Sampras eats for breakfast? That has got to get the guy thinking with his
current form.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not going to play Wimbledon again. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m curious how
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d do, especially with all the guys staying back. I always licked my
chops when I saw baselinersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦A lot of things come into play. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
a lot of work. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a daily grind. I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play Wimbledon
just to play. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d play to win. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got to be a reason to
come back, and there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a reason. To come back for one event is
crazy.Ã¢â‚¬Â - Pete.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are currently no strict SVers on tour at the moment who have a chance at
winning Wimbledon. Tim Henman is nearing retirement and his serve and volley
is no where near that of Sampras. Mario Ancic isn't living up to his potential
and seems to be more of baseliner these days. Taylor Dent is recovering from
surgery so who knows when he can play again. Mark Philippoussis hasn't been
competitive since getting destroyed by Federer in the 2003 final. The only
other guy to impress me - Takeo Suzuki isn't even in the top 300 and hasn't
been beyond the round of 64 at Wimbledon before. So players on tour aren't
facing the sort of SV game that Sampras can bring.</p>

<p>The big question that Sampras needs to answer before he can even entertain
taking on Wimbledon is his fitness. He doesn't have the fitness to play on
tour and won't have it anytime soon. But his ability to make points extremely
short on grass makes Wimbledon, more so than any other slam, a possibility.</p>

<p>Personally I would love to see Sampras do a best of 3 set exhibition match
again Federer to answer the "What If?" question that has been plaguing
everyone since their 2001 battle. What if Sampras in his prime faced Federer
in his prime? I am not sure but I would love to find out.</p>
