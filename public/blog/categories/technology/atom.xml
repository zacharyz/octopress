apps" /></p>

<p>Gone are the days of carrying a stopwatch and a notepad for workouts. These
days the number one tool is something many people carry with them - an iPhone.
For under $5 you can buy several apps that will make tracking your weight loss
a breeze. In this article I will cover the apps that I use on a daily basis to
track my progress and workouts.</p>

<h3>Lose It! (free)</h3>

<p>My favorite app by far is called Lose It! which just so happens to be free so
there is no excuse for not at least giving it a try. Lose It! is my tool of
choice for tracking my calories and my workouts.</p>

<p>Overview of how I use it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Track the calorie content of every meal that I eat.</li>
<li>Track every workout that I have.</li>
<li>Schedule 4 "motivator" alarms to remind me to eat on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Track my overall progress towards my weight goal.</li>
<li>Email me weekly reports</li>
<li>Share on facebook/twitter your exercises.</li>
<li>Share with my friends my weight loss progress and see theirs within the app.
That last feature is huge. Losing weight is way more interesting when you are
doing it with others. Watching daily/weekly progress of others is hugely
motivating.</li>
</ul>


<p>I used to keep a journal of all my workouts and exercises. Then I used to keep
a txt document and eventually a google doc of all my progress. Using a simple
<em>and free!</em> app to do it is so much easier.</p>

<h3>C25k ($2.99)</h3>

<p>In high-school I used to run cross country. It was just something I did in
between baseball and wrestling seasons to stay in shape. It was fun to meet
with friends after school and follow whatever workout the coach decided to
use. The best I ever got was around a 19 minute 5 kilometer race (6:30 mile
pace).</p>

<p>Those days are long gone.</p>

<p>Today I dread running and am lucky to run a 10 minute mile. This is something
that I want to change with the help of a very popular beginning running
program called Couch to 5k. It is a 9 week gradual program, where you are free
to go at your own pace. The over all goal is to be able to go from never
having run - to be able to run 5 kilometers without stopping.</p>

<p>There are a couple of popular apps on the iPhone that help you with this
program. I chose one called C25k based on its reviews but any of them will
probably do and will run you about $3. What it provides are audio cues for
when to warmup, run, walk and cool-down. It is basically a coach in your hand
that goes at your own pace. I recently finished my 7th week of the program and
am getting to the point where I feel comfortable running for 25 minutes - in a
few weeks I hope to be able to run for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>I will cover why I am focusing so much on running with my diet in a future
post.</p>

<h3>Nike+ (free + cost of sensor)</h3>

<p>Nike+ works in conjunction with a sensor that you put on your shoe that
measures the distance that you run. It has been around since before the iPhone
and I have been using it since the beginning because I am a stat tracking
junkie. I use it with C25k to measure my pace and track my runs.</p>

<p>The app itself is free and included with your iPhone or iPod Touch if you have
the sensor, which can be picked up in most running stores. It isn't the most
accurate device since it is heavily dependent on having a consistent stride
and can be a pain to properly calibrate. But it is still an excellent tool for
creating running workouts and tracking your progress.</p>

<p>The real meat is on the Nike+ website that saves all your runs (I have some
going back to 2007) that allows you to set personal goals (run 100 miles in a
year!) and see cute graphs of your runs.</p>

<p>Long after I have graduated from the C25k program I will still be using Nike+.</p>

<h3>100 pushups and 200 situps ($1.99 each)</h3>

<p>Another popular set of fitness programs are <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">100
pushups</a> and <a href="http://www.twohundredsitups.com/">200 sit-ups
</a>.</p>

<p>Both workout programs are free to follow. I urge that you visit those sites to
get an idea of what is involved but I use these apps to help track my progress
and like the C25k program - get audio cues of when to workout or cool-down. I
am a huge fan of doing body weight exercises and both of those programs are
excellent. Last year I came very close to being able to do 100 pushups in a
row and 60 sit-ups in a minute with the aid of those apps.</p>

<p>Combine these programs with a pull-up workout and you will be in amazing shape
without the cost of a gym membership.</p>

<h3>iFitness ($1.99)</h3>

<p>iFitness is one of the top rated fitness related apps on the iPhone at 5 stars
and it is one of the best bargains too. I used to get annoyed with how often
the developer updated the app with new features. Today it is incredibly
polished and useful tool.</p>

<p>What it provides is a way to track workouts - how many sets, how much you
should be lifting each set, and what exercises you should be doing during the
workout. In the past I have used the <a href="http://stronglifts.com/">StrongLifts</a>
workout program to great success and it was easily tracked using iFitness.</p>

<p>It also provides a huge encyclopedia of exercises complete with videos
demonstrating proper form. It also has weight tracking and the ability to mail
yourself workout logs.</p>

<p>These are the 5 apps I use to motivate myself and track my weight loss
progress. Throughout the year I will be discussing extensively how I use them
to lose 30 lbs and get a level of fitness that I am proud of.</p>

<p>Do you use your iPhone to achieve your desired results? If so I would love to
hear how you do it.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <link href="http://dakry.com/blog/2010/01/18/i-wrote-a-gallery-that-uses-flickr-google-maps/"/>
    <updated>2010-01-18T22:16:49-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://dakry.com/blog/2010/01/18/i-wrote-a-gallery-that-uses-flickr-google-maps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://za%0Adell.com/gallery/photo.php?id=3868448361"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4009/4287010500_9a22620993.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I had been toying around with the idea of using the flickr api with google
maps for a while. So a couple of weekends ago I decided to take a break from
client work and hammer something out. The result is my <a href="/gallery">gallery</a>.
The goals for the project were the following:</p>

<h2>Use flickr's and google's map apis.</h2>

<p>Both are apis that I have known about, and wanted to work with for a while,
but hadn't had chance to use on scale larger than minor wordpress widgets. In
the past my experience was limited to using jQuery to access my most recent
photos from flickr. I wanted something a bit more powerful and flexible and an
excuse to use php which my web host supports. I ended up settling on a
relatively good PHP wrapper called <a href="phpflickr.com">phpflickr</a></p>

<p>Displaying a map was surprisingly easy. Once I extracted the longitude and
latitude information from the photo I was able to use a couple google maps
function calls to create a map around that location with a marker on it.</p>

<h2>Create a way to display my photos in a meaningful way on my site</h2>

<p>There are lots of gallery plugins and widgets around the net. I wanted
something though that was completely customizable both in how it displays
images and how it is used. For example - if I wanted to pull from a specific
set of photos, I can do that. Also if wanted to be able to mine data about my
photographic behaviors, such as what my favorite apertures and focal range
were - those are not typically available with "off the shelf" options.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with flickr itself is its white background which doesn't
work well with photography. I find it distracting and prefer a darker
background (hence the color scheme of this site). People often use sites like
that of <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/">big huge labs</a> to display their picture on a
black background. I wanted to avoid having to use an external site.</p>

<p>I also wanted the ability to readily display information that I find important
- such as the camera, lens, aperture, iso, and shutter speed I used. I also
wanted to toy with the idea of showing (when available) the location of where
I took the photo on a google map.</p>

<p>Additionally I wanted to use some javascript to make it possible to expand the
photos, so that users will not need to leave the site to better view my
pictures. To achieve this I used a javascript library called <a href="http://highslide.com/">highslide
JS</a>.</p>

<p>The final result of my weekend coding session is a relatively minimalist
interface that gives the viewer all the information that I consider important.</p>

    <link href="http://dakry.com/blog/2009/08/27/augmented-reality-comes-to-the-iphone-3gs/"/>
    <updated>2009-08-27T16:33:48-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dakry.com/blog/2009/08/27/augmented-reality-comes-to-the-iphone-3gs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/IMG_0122.PNG" alt="" /> One of my favorite books ever is Snow Crash by Neal
Stephenson. It is a sci-fi novel centered around a sword wielding computer
hacker that has been extremely influential to many people working with
computers today. The word "avatar" in reference to a computer representation
of a person was first coined in this book - so just about every major MMO or
Virtual Reality system that has come out has been influenced by this book.</p>

<p>Another cool idea from Snow Crash was that of a "gargoyle," which is basically
an individual who is perpetually connected to the net - complete with an eye
piece display that enables them pull up information about their surroundings
at all time. This is slowly becoming a reality and Yelp is doing their part by
bringing the first Augmented Reality app to the iPhone 3GS.</p>

<p>Yelp quietly snuck the feature into their latest update - revealed by shaking
your phone 3 times. After that a dialog pops up stating how Yelp thought
reality was boring - so they augmented it. From that point on the yelp app
displays a monocle option that allows you to use the 3GS's camera to look
around and display yelp information.</p>

<p>Yelp isn't the first AR app, but they are the first on the iphone. On android
based phones - like the G1, there have been other AR apps - in particular that
of <a href="http://layar.eu/">Layer</a>. Not until the 3GS did the iphone have a compass
which is crucial for determining which direction the user is pointing. Even
still the iphone was not supposed to see any AR apps until the next release of
the iphone OS software - so yelp is being sneaky by releasing it early.
Hopefully they aren't angering the gods over at Apple.</p>

    <updated>2009-07-22T14:55:02-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dakry.com/blog/2009/07/22/why-grado-labs-deserves-your-money</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in about 2003 I was really getting into listening to music. I was tired
of lame computer speakers and my gameboy headphones from 1989 were no longer
cutting it. To satisfy my desire to have clear, quality audio I got a pair of
<a href="http://gradolabs.com/product_pages/sr80.htm">Grado SR-80</a> headphones. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grado_Labs">Grado
Labs</a> isn't as famous to the average
music enthusiast as Sennheiser or Sony but around Hi-Fi audiophiles Grado has
made a name for themselves for providing a very crisp, neutral sound that is
true to the source material.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7637913@N07/3746485759/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/374648%0A5759_a7558de632_z.jpg" alt="kickin it with old school style" /></a>G
rado Labs is based out of Brooklyn and is a family owned business with the
sole purpose of manufacturing quality high-end audio products and it shows.
They make a wide range of headphones going from $49 iGrado street-style
headphones all the way up to crazy $1695 PS1000. The SR-80s were about $95
when I bought them. The main selling point for me was that they offered a
sound that was comparable to headphones that cost significantly more. If your
experience with headphones is limited to the cheap white ones that came with
your ipod then you are missing out on lot of detail in your music.</p>

<p>In about 2005 my headphones died due to a loose connection in one of the
drivers - probably because of over use. After a brief attempt at repairing
them myself which resulted in a mess of solder, I gave up not wanting to risk
doing more damage. In May of 2007 I was still bummed that these great
headphones were going to waste because of a tiny wire so I decided to send a
message to Grado to see if they could repair them. Despite the fact that the
headphones were a few years old they told me to send it in to the factory.</p>

<p>Holy Crap could a company really be that cool?</p>

<p>Thanks to my laziness I wouldn't find out for another 2 years. At the
beginning of July I decided to take a chance and mailed off the headphones
along with a letter explaining my situation. I figured my options were to
either trash these headphones which were going on nearly 3 years of not being
used or to send them off to Grado where the worst that could happen is that
they would be recycled.</p>

<p>Well today I got an unexpected delivery in the mail from Grado. In the box
were my repaired headphones free of charge and they sound as good as they ever
have.</p>

<p>Thank you so much Grado!</p>
